## Overview

The PM System is GitHub-native project management infrastructure — not a separate application. It uses GitHub Issues, Projects v2, milestones, YAML issue forms, GitHub Actions, and the `work progress` CLI command to provide structured work tracking for a solo developer working with concurrent AI agent sessions.

The canonical operational reference is [`docs/PM.md`](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/blob/main/docs/PM.md). This overview describes what the system is and how its pieces fit together.

## Architecture

### 6-Dimension Label Taxonomy

Every issue is categorized across up to 6 dimensions. Three are required:

| Dimension | Prefix | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Type** | `type/*` | What kind of work | `type/feature`, `type/bug`, `type/research`, `type/tech-debt` |
| **Priority** | `priority/*` | When to do it | `priority/now`, `priority/next`, `priority/later`, `priority/icebox` |
| **Product** | `product/*` | Things users DO | `product/quotes`, `product/jobs`, `product/customers` |
| **Domain** | `domain/*` | Things products USE | `domain/garments`, `domain/pricing`, `domain/dtf` |
| **Tool** | `tool/*` | How we BUILD | `tool/work-orchestrator`, `tool/ci-pipeline`, `tool/pm-system` |
| Pipeline | `pipeline/*` | Pipeline type (optional) | `pipeline/vertical`, `pipeline/horizontal` |
| Phase | `phase/*` | Which project phase (optional) | `phase/1`, `phase/2` |
| Source | `source/*` | How we found it (optional) | `source/interview`, `source/review`, `source/testing` |

Each issue needs at minimum one scope label: `product/*`, `domain/*`, or `tool/*`. Labels encode stable categorical metadata. Runtime state (current status, effort, pipeline stage) lives on project board fields.

### Projects v2 Board

[Screen Print Pro board](https://github.com/users/cmbays/projects/4) — user-owned Projects v2 with 8 custom fields:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Status | Single Select | Triage → Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done |
| Priority | Single Select | Urgent, High, Normal, Low |
| Product | Single Select | Dashboard, Quotes, Customers, Invoices, Jobs, Garments, Screens, Pricing |
| Tool | Single Select | Work Orchestrator, Skills Framework, Agent System, Knowledge Base, CI Pipeline, PM System |
| Pipeline ID | Text | Format: `YYYYMMDD-topic` |
| Pipeline Stage | Single Select | Research through Wrap-up |
| Effort | Single Select | Trivial, Small, Medium, Large |
| Phase | Single Select | Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 |

**Views**: Board (by Status), By Product (table), Pipeline Tracker (by Pipeline Stage), Roadmap.

### YAML Issue Forms

Four templates enforce consistent issue creation. Blank issues are disabled.

| Template | Auto-Label | Key Fields |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Feature Request | `type/feature` | Description, Product/Tool, Acceptance Criteria |
| Bug Report | `type/bug` | What happened, Expected behavior, Steps to reproduce |
| Research Task | `type/research` | Goal, Questions, Product/Tool |
| Tracking Issue | `type/tooling` | Goal, Sub-issues planned, Milestone context |

### GitHub Actions

| Action | Trigger | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Auto-add to project | Issue/PR opened | Adds to board #4 |
| PR Labeler | PR opened/synced | Applies `product/*` / `domain/*` / `tool/*` labels by file path |
| Template labels | Issue created via form | Applies `type/*` label |

### `work progress` Command

Queries GitHub API for live project state and writes a gitignored `PROGRESS.md`:

```bash
work progress              # Generate to repo root
work progress --output .   # Write to current directory
```

Sections: Milestones, Now (priority/now), Next (priority/next), Tracked In (sub-issues), Recent PRs (7 days), Stale (>30 days).

## How Agents Use It

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Find priority work | `gh issue list -l priority/next --json number,title,labels` |
| Find work by product | `gh issue list -l product/quotes --json number,title,state` |
| Create a feature issue | `gh issue create --template feature-request.yml --title "..." --label "product/...,priority/..."` |
| Update issue priority | `gh issue edit 123 --add-label "priority/now" --remove-label "priority/next"` |
| Close with PR reference | `gh issue close 123 --comment "Resolved in PR #456"` |
| Add sub-issue | GraphQL `addSubIssue` mutation (see `docs/PM.md` Section 5) |
| Create deferred work | `gh issue create --label "type/tech-debt,priority/later,product/...,source/review"` |

Agents read `docs/PM.md` at session start for full PM context. The Quick Reference section (Section 1) provides copy-paste `gh` commands.

## How Humans Use It

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Visual board overview | [Project board](https://github.com/users/cmbays/projects/4) — Board view for status, By Product for scope |
| Progress check | `work progress` → read PROGRESS.md |
| Grooming | Interactive session: present each issue, decide labels/priority/close |
| Betting | Select issues from backlog → assign to milestone → set `priority/now` |
| Smoke testing | Test on preview deployment → create issues for findings (`source/testing`) |

## Key Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `gh issue list -l priority/now` | See current cycle work |
| `gh issue list -l priority/next` | See up-next work |
| `gh issue list --milestone "D-Day"` | See milestone progress |
| `gh issue create --template <name>.yml` | Create structured issue |
| `gh issue edit N --add-label "..." --remove-label "..."` | Update labels |
| `gh issue close N --comment "..."` | Close with context |
| `work progress` | Generate live progress report |
