## Decision Log

### 2026-02-14: GitHub Issues Over Linear

**Decision:** Use GitHub Issues as the PM tool, not Linear.

**Rationale:** Linear is designed for multi-human team coordination (sprints, triage queues, velocity tracking). Our "team" is one developer + multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions — a fundamentally different coordination model. GitHub Issues are already in the workflow: `gh` CLI for agents, PR-to-issue linking is automatic, and issues live with the code (no sync tax).

**Alternatives rejected:**
- **Linear** — Two MCP plugins available (including Linear MCP from the project-management-suite). Rejected because it optimizes for human-team coordination patterns we don't use. Would require syncing between Linear and GitHub for PR linking.
- **Jira/Notion** — Not considered seriously. Both add overhead and separation from code without benefits for this project's workflow.

### 2026-02-16: Issue Types Not Viable on Personal Repos

**Decision:** Keep `type/*` labels instead of adopting GitHub's native Issue Types.

**Rationale:** Spike tested `gh issue type list`, `gh issue type create`, and `gh issue type list --type` on the personal repo. Findings:
- `gh` CLI 2.86.0 has zero issue type support (no subcommands, no flags)
- GraphQL `createIssueType` mutation exists but requires `admin:org` scope (only `read:org` available)
- Types are owner-level (apply across ALL repos), not repo-level

**Alternatives rejected:**
- **Native Issue Types** — would be cleaner but the tooling gap makes them unusable for agent workflows that rely entirely on `gh` CLI.

**Revisit when:** `gh` CLI adds native issue type support.

### 2026-02-16: `type/ux-review` Folded into `source/review`

**Decision:** Delete the `type/ux-review` label and reclassify affected issues as `source/review` with appropriate `type/*` labels.

**Rationale:** UX review items describe *how the work was found* (during review), not *what kind of work it is*. The same review finding could be a bug, feature, or refactor. Using `type/ux-review` conflated the source dimension with the type dimension, breaking the one-mechanism-per-dimension rule.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- **Fold into `type/feedback`** — considered but `source/review` is more precise. Feedback is broader (user suggestions, ideas). Review findings are specifically from code/design review sessions.

### 2026-02-16: Wave-Parallel Execution Over Monolithic Build

**Decision:** Execute PM Overhaul as 3 waves with parallelism within each wave (Shape B), not as a single sequential session (Shape A).

**Rationale:** 10 tasks with clear dependency boundaries. Wave 1 (4 tasks) has no mutual dependencies — all run concurrently. Wave 2 (4 tasks) depends on Wave 1 outputs but has no internal dependencies. Wave 3 (2 tasks) is inherently serial (grooming needs human, PM doc needs grooming). Shape A passes all requirements but sequential execution risks D-Day deadline — single session failure has no recovery path.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- **Shape A: Monolithic** — passes requirements but sequential with no resilience
- **Shape C: Quick Wins** — fails R1 (sub-issue structure), R3 (dependency visibility), R7 (progress generation) by deferring them to "if time permits"

### 2026-02-16: User-Owned Project (Not Org-Owned)

**Decision:** Create the Projects v2 board as a user-owned project (`@me`), not an organization project.

**Rationale:** `cmbays/print-4ink` is a personal repo. Org-owned projects require organization-level permissions and configuration. User-owned projects are simpler to manage and match the repo ownership model.

### 2026-02-16: PROGRESS.md as Gitignored Generated Artifact

**Decision:** Make PROGRESS.md a gitignored file generated by `work progress`, not a hand-edited tracked file.

**Rationale:** PROGRESS.md was a "hot file" — multiple concurrent worktrees would edit it, causing merge conflicts. Making it a compiled artifact from live GitHub API data solves three problems simultaneously: eliminates merge conflicts, prevents staleness (always queries live data), and matches the two-audience pattern (agents read files, humans read boards — both generated from the same GitHub Issues source of truth).

**Alternatives rejected:**
- **Keep as tracked file** — perpetual merge conflicts in concurrent sessions
- **Update only on main** — still requires manual editing, still goes stale between updates

### 2026-02-16: Backlog Target Relaxed from 40-45 to 98

**Decision:** Accept 98 open issues (starting count) with 16 priority/next items instead of the planned ~40-45 issues with 8-10 priority/next.

**Rationale:** The planning estimate of 67 open issues was stale — actual count at grooming time was 98. The target of closing ~25 issues to reach 40-45 assumed many duplicates and stale items. In practice, most issues were legitimate work items. The user made deliberate keep decisions during interactive grooming, retaining 16 items as priority/next (above the 8-10 target) based on near-term value assessment. The grooming process was thorough — all issues received correct labels and board placement — the output count simply didn't match the estimated target.
