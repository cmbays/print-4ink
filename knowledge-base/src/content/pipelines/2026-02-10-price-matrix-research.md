## Research at a Glance

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Competitors Analyzed | 10 |
| Industry Sources | 80+ |
| Research Agents | 4 |
| Features Prioritized | 36 |

**The Opportunity:** No competitor has pulled away — PrintLife, YoPrint, Teesom, and PriceIt are all tied at 74%. Screen Print Pro can leapfrog everyone by combining PrintLife's automation with Teesom's flexibility, YoPrint's innovation, and a 10x better UX.

## Executive Summary

Four research agents worked in parallel to analyze the screen printing price matrix landscape: industry best practices, competitor solutions, cross-vertical integration requirements, and UX/UI innovation patterns.

### How Screen Printing Pricing Works

Pricing is a **multi-dimensional matrix** where per-piece cost is calculated from:

```
Price = (Garment Cost x Markup) + (Setup Fees / Quantity) + (Colors x Locations x Per-Hit Rate) + Surcharges
```

The primary drivers are **quantity breaks** (12, 24, 48, 72, 144+), **color count** (each color = one screen), **print locations** (front, back, sleeves), and **garment type** (t-shirt vs. hoodie). Secondary factors include setup fees ($15-35/screen), specialty inks (+$0.50-1.50/print), and rush orders (+10-100%).

### The 10x Strategy

PrintLife optimizes for *automation at the expense of visibility*. We optimize for **both**. Three pillars:

1. **Simplicity** — Wizard setup in 5 minutes with smart defaults (match PrintLife's 5/5)
2. **Transparency** — Real-time margin % per price cell with green/yellow/red indicators (PrintLife's blind spot)
3. **Flexibility** — Unlimited matrices, power mode grid, CSV import/export (PrintLife's 2/5 → our 5/5)

## Competitor Landscape

### The Print Life — Our Baseline

**4Ink's Current Tool — 74% (26/35)**

| Criterion | Rating | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Capabilities | 3/5 | Basic matrix types, recently added measurement-based pricing |
| User Satisfaction | 3/5 | Positive on automation, limited public reviews |
| Ease of Use | 4/5 | Designed to "just work" with low learning curve |
| **Flexibility** | **2/5** | Basic structures only. No custom rules, no breakless pricing |
| Simplicity | **5/5** | Core strength — prevents overwhelm |
| Integration | 4/5 | All-in-one: quoting → production → shipping |
| Automation | **5/5** | Prevents common errors (forgetting setup fees, ink charges) |

### Competitive Ratings

| Competitor | Score |
|------------|-------|
| Print Life | 74% |
| YoPrint | 74% |
| Teesom | 74% |
| PriceIt | 74% |
| DecoNetwork | 69% |
| Printavo | 69% |
| ShopWorx | 69% |
| OrderMyGear | 66% |
| InkSoft | 60% |

### Where We Win

```
                    High Flexibility
                         |
              Teesom o   |   * Screen Print Pro
                         |      (TARGET)
                         |
 Low Automation ----------+-------- High Automation
                         |
          ShopWorx o     |     o Print Life
                         |     o Printavo
                         |
                    Low Flexibility
```

No current competitor occupies the **high automation + high flexibility** quadrant. That's our target.

### Key Innovations to Adopt

| Innovation | Source | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Breakless pricing | YoPrint | Eliminates quantity break gaming, fairer pricing |
| Vendor cost sync | YoPrint | Auto-update garment costs from SanMar, AlphaBroder |
| Size matrix entry | ShopWorx | S:10, M:25, L:15 in one line — 3x faster |
| Production variables | ShopWorx | Price by mesh count, ink type, squeegee |
| Area-based pricing | DecoNetwork | Per-square-inch pricing by color count |
| Unlimited matrices | Teesom | No artificial limits on pricing configs |

## Integration Architecture

Industry leaders treat pricing as a **centralized calculation engine** consumed by all verticals — not a lookup table embedded in the quote form.

### Data Flow

**Customer Context** → **Price Matrix Engine** → **Quote** (with margin) → **Price Lock on Approval** → **Invoice** (honors locked prices) → **Production** (tracks actual costs) → **Reporting** (margin analysis) → feedback to Price Matrix calibration

### Five Integration Points

1. **Customer** — Contract pricing, loyalty tiers, manual discount authority with approval workflow
2. **Quoting** — Primary consumer. Auto-calculated quotes, margin visibility, price locking, quote versioning
3. **Invoicing** — Quote-to-invoice conversion with price locking, progress billing (50% deposit), tax, audit trail
4. **Reporting** — Margin by job/customer/product, pricing trends, discount impact analysis
5. **Production** — Actual vs. estimated costs, variance tracking, realized margin per job

## UX Strategy — 10x Better

### Progressive Disclosure

### Simple Mode (Default)

5-step wizard — enter shop basics, choose structure, set breakpoints, auto-calculate with smart defaults, preview with sample orders. New shop gets pricing in 5 minutes.

### Power Mode (Advanced Toggle)

TanStack Table with inline editing, keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, Ctrl+C/V), bulk actions, CSV import/export, fill handle for dragging values. Excel-like power without leaving the app.

### Real-Time Margin Indicators

Every price cell gets a color indicator using our Niji palette:

| Margin | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| >= 30% | Green (#54ca74) | Healthy profit |
| 15-30% | Yellow (#ffc663) | Low profit, caution |
| < 15% | Red (#d23e08) | Unprofitable |

Tooltip on hover: *"Margin: 32% ($450 revenue - $306 cost = $144 profit)"*

### Pain Points We Solve

| Industry Pain Point | Our Solution |
|---------------------|-------------|
| "Don't understand pricing after 3 years" (Shopvox) | Wizard setup, done in 5 minutes |
| No profitability reporting | Real-time margin % per cell + dashboard |
| No labor cost tracking | Factor hourly rate, setup time, press time |
| Can't experiment with pricing | What-if scenarios, undo/redo, version history |
| Manual Excel workflows | CSV import/export, inline editing |
