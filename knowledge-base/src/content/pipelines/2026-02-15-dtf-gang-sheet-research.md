## Context

4Ink is adding a DTF Gang Sheet Builder as a new vertical. Gary (shop owner) runs DTF printing **in-house** — he has his own DTF printer and builds gang sheets to optimize film usage for customer orders. The existing Shopify storefront uses the Drip Apps "Build a Gang Sheet" Shopify app for customer-facing orders, but the production management software (Screen Print Pro) needs its own gang sheet building capability integrated into the production workflow.

The existing codebase already has DTF pricing schemas (`lib/schemas/dtf-pricing.ts`), a DTF pricing editor (`/settings/pricing/dtf/[id]`), and DTF as a service type in the quoting system. This research focuses on the **gang sheet builder** — the visual tool for arranging multiple designs on a single DTF film sheet.

```

## Competitor Landscape

### The Two Product Categories

Gang sheet builders split into two distinct categories:

1. **Customer-facing Shopify/WooCommerce apps** — embedded in online stores, customers upload designs and build their own gang sheets, output feeds into shop's order queue
2. **Production-focused desktop/web apps** — used by the shop operator to arrange orders onto gang sheets, optimize nesting, generate print-ready files for RIP software

4Ink needs **both**: Drip Apps handles the customer-facing side (already in use), and Screen Print Pro should handle the production/operations side.

## Industry Workflow: In-House DTF Gang Sheet Production

### Standard 6-Step Workflow

Based on research across multiple sources, the standard in-house DTF production workflow is:

1. **Order Intake** — Receive customer orders with artwork files (from Shopify/walk-ins/email)
2. **File Validation** — Check resolution (300 DPI minimum), verify transparency, confirm dimensions
3. **Gang Sheet Layout** — Arrange multiple orders' designs onto gang sheets to maximize film usage
4. **Nesting Optimization** — Rotate/rearrange designs to minimize waste (10-40% savings possible)
5. **Print & Cure** — Send to RIP software, print on DTF film, powder, and heat-cure
6. **Cut & Press** — Cut individual transfers, heat-press onto garments

### Key Pain Points for Small Shops

1. **Manual layout is slow** — Arranging in Photoshop/CorelDRAW takes 10-45 minutes per sheet
2. **Wasted film = wasted money** — Poor nesting wastes 10-40% of film
3. **Human errors cause reprints** — Overlapping designs, wrong sizes, low-resolution files
4. **No connection between orders and sheets** — Shops manually track which order goes on which sheet
5. **Scaling bottleneck** — Cannot handle 20+ orders/day with manual processes

### What 4Ink's In-House Workflow Likely Looks Like

```
Customer Order (Shopify/walk-in)
    → Gary receives artwork files
    → Opens Drip Apps builder OR manually arranges in design software
    → Decides which orders to batch together on a sheet
    → Arranges designs, optimizes spacing
    → Exports gang sheet file (PNG/PDF)
    → Imports into RIP software
    → Prints on DTF film
    → Powders and cures
    → Cuts individual transfers
    → Heat-presses onto garments
    → Ships/delivers
```

The gap in this workflow: **no production management between order intake and gang sheet building**. Screen Print Pro can bridge this gap.

## UX Patterns That Work

### Core Builder Interface Pattern (All Competitors)

Every gang sheet builder follows this pattern:

1. **Canvas** — Fixed 22" width, variable length, visual representation of the film sheet
2. **Upload zone** — Drag-drop or click-to-upload area for design files
3. **Design thumbnails** — Gallery of uploaded designs with size indicators
4. **Manipulation tools** — Resize (maintain aspect ratio), rotate, duplicate, delete
5. **Sheet size selector** — Dropdown or visual picker for length tiers
6. **Space utilization indicator** — Shows how much of the sheet is used vs. wasted
7. **Auto-arrange button** — One-click nesting optimization (premium feature)

### What Separates Good From Great

| Pattern         | Basic (Drip Apps)    | Advanced (DTF Transfer Studio)                              |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nesting         | Manual drag-drop     | AI auto-nesting with multiple algorithms                    |
| File validation | Basic format check   | DPI check, transparency detection, color profile validation |
| Sheet sizing    | Fixed tier selection | Dynamic sizing (auto-shrink to smallest needed)             |
| Output          | PNG/PDF              | TIFF with spot channels, CutContour paths                   |
| Order tracking  | Per-order            | Batch orders onto sheets with job tracking                  |
| Template reuse  | None                 | Save and reuse layout templates                             |

### UX Patterns Specific to Production (vs. Customer-Facing)

Production tools add:

- **Order queue** — See pending orders that need gang sheets built
- **Batch grouping** — Group orders by due date, customer, rush status
- **Job linking** — Each design on a sheet links back to its source order/job
- **Print queue** — Queue finished gang sheets for printing in order
- **Waste tracking** — Monitor film utilization percentage over time
- **Reprint detection** — Flag designs that have been printed before (template reuse)

## Internal Audit: What We Can Reuse

### Existing Assets

| Asset                  | Location                                        | Reusable For                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DTF pricing schema     | `lib/schemas/dtf-pricing.ts`                    | Sheet tier pricing, rush fees, film types, customer discounts |
| DTF pricing editor     | `/settings/pricing/dtf/[id]`                    | Settings UI patterns, tier editor component                   |
| DTF sheet tier editor  | `components/.../DTFSheetTierEditor.tsx`         | Sheet size tier management                                    |
| DTF pricing calculator | `components/.../DTFPricingCalculator.tsx`       | Price calculation with customer tier/rush/film type           |
| Service type enum      | `lib/schemas/quote.ts` → `serviceTypeEnum`      | DTF as `"dtf"` service type                                   |
| Pricing engine         | `lib/pricing-engine.ts` → `calculateDTFPrice()` | DTF-specific price calculations                               |
| Mock DTF templates     | `lib/mock-data-pricing.ts`                      | Test data for DTF sheets                                      |
| Quote line items       | `lib/schemas/quote.ts`                          | DTF line items in quotes                                      |

### What Needs to Be Built

1. **Gang sheet canvas component** — Visual 22"-wide canvas with drag-drop design placement
2. **Design upload/management** — File upload, thumbnail generation, dimension tracking
3. **Nesting algorithm** — Auto-arrange designs to minimize waste (can start with simple bin-packing)
4. **Gang sheet schema** — New Zod schema linking gang sheets to jobs/orders
5. **Gang sheet list/detail views** — CRUD screens for managing gang sheets
6. **Order-to-sheet workflow** — UI for selecting which orders to batch onto a sheet

### Schema Gaps

The existing DTF pricing schema handles **how much to charge**. The gang sheet builder needs schemas for:

- **Gang sheet** — id, dimensions, designs (with positions/sizes), linked jobs/orders, status, created date
- **Design placement** — design image ref, x/y position, width/height, rotation, source order ID
- **Sheet queue** — ordered list of gang sheets ready for printing

## Key Findings and Recommendations

### Finding 1: Two Distinct Workflows

The customer-facing builder (Drip Apps on Shopify) and the production builder (Screen Print Pro) serve different purposes. The Shopify app lets customers build their own sheets for ordering. Screen Print Pro should let Gary arrange **his pending orders** onto sheets for production.

### Finding 2: Auto-Nesting Is Table Stakes

Every serious competitor has auto-nesting. Manual drag-drop is the baseline. For Phase 1 mockup, a visual canvas with manual arrangement is sufficient, but the UI should have an "Auto-Arrange" button (even if it uses a simple algorithm) to demonstrate the concept.

### Finding 3: Sheet Size Pricing Already Exists

The DTF pricing schema and editor already handle the 10 sheet size tiers (22" x 24" through 22" x 240"). The gang sheet builder should consume this data to show pricing as the user builds.

### Finding 4: The Killer Feature Is Order-to-Sheet

What no competitor fully solves: **connecting production orders to gang sheet layouts**. Shopify apps are customer-facing. Desktop tools are standalone. Screen Print Pro can uniquely link jobs → gang sheets → production status, giving Gary visibility into what's on each sheet and which orders are fulfilled.

### Finding 5: Phase 1 Scope Should Be Visual + Mock

For the Feb 21 demo, the gang sheet builder needs:

- Visual canvas with sheet size selection
- Upload/add designs with drag-drop arrangement
- Resize, rotate, duplicate controls
- Space utilization indicator
- "Auto-Arrange" button (simple packing)
- Link to pending DTF jobs/orders

This is sufficient to validate the concept with Gary. Advanced features (halftoning, transparency cleanup, RIP integration) are Phase 2/3.

## Gary Questions
