## Summary

This session connects the Customer Management data model to the existing Quoting vertical. The CustomerCombobox now surfaces lifecycle stages, type tags, and contact roles — giving the shop owner richer context when selecting a customer on a quote.

## What Changed

### CustomerCombobox — Enriched Dropdown

- **Lifecycle badges** replace legacy tag badges in the dropdown list (prospect, new, repeat, contract with semantic colors)
- **Expanded search** — type "contract", "wholesale", "sports" to filter by lifecycle stage or type tags
- **Enriched info card** when a customer is selected:
  - Company name (prominent, first row)
  - Contact name + role badge (Ordering, Billing, Art Approver, etc.)
  - Email + phone
  - Lifecycle badge + type tag badges (Retail, Sports/School, Corporate, etc.)
  - "View Customer" link → `/customers/{id}` in new tab

### QuoteForm — Customer Option Mapping

Added `customerOptions` useMemo that maps full Customer objects to CustomerOption with a derived `contactRole` from the primary contact. This keeps the combobox interface clean while surfacing rich data.

### QuoteDetailView — Lifecycle Badge

Replaced the legacy `CustomerTag` badge with the `LifecycleBadge` component in the quote detail header. Now shows "Prospect", "New", "Repeat", or "Contract" with matching semantic colors.
