## Problem

PR reviews are manual and inconsistent. The building agent self-invokes reviewers (fox guarding henhouse), specialized checks get skipped, and technical debt slips through. With 7+ verticals, 529+ tests, and concurrent worktrees, manual review orchestration doesn't scale.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Config format | JSON (not YAML) | Rules are agent-authored; description fields are validated data (YAML comments are invisible to Zod) |
| Invocation model | build-session-protocol integration | Quality gate on every build PR, not a manual command |
| Classifier layers | Config base + LLM gap detector + gap logger | Deterministic base for speed, LLM for coverage, gap log for self-improvement |
| Rule scope | Existing agents only (~60 rules) | New agents (#310) are a separate issue |
| Schema separation | Config schemas + pipeline schemas | Data at rest vs data in motion — separate concerns |
| Gate logic | Severity metrics, not rule counts | Self-maintaining as rules are added/removed (SonarQube pattern) |
| Agent output | Structured JSON (migrated from markdown) | Enables machine aggregation across agents |

## Professional Patterns Applied

Seven industry-standard patterns inform the architecture:

1. **Rule Engine** (Drools/OPA) — Decouple facts/rules/execution; rules are config, not code
2. **Quality Gate** (SonarQube) — Severity-driven gating on aggregate metrics
3. **Uniform Finding Format** (ESLint/Semgrep) — All agents output same `ReviewFinding[]` schema
4. **Plugin Architecture** (ESLint/Webpack) — Agents registered in config, loaded at runtime
5. **Pipeline/Middleware** (Koa/Express) — 6 stages, each a pure function with validated I/O
6. **Policy as Code** (OPA/Rego) — Composition policies are declarative JSON config
7. **Batch Reporting** (Danger.js) — Single atomic report, not individual PR comments

## Architecture

6-stage pipeline with Zod-validated boundaries:

```
Normalize → Classify → Compose → Gap Detect → Dispatch → Aggregate
```

- **Stage 1 (Normalize)**: Extract immutable PRFacts from git diff
- **Stage 2 (Classify)**: Deterministic glob→domain matching from config
- **Stage 3 (Compose)**: Declarative policy evaluation → agent manifest
- **Stage 4 (Gap Detect)**: LLM analyzes diff for concerns config missed; logs gaps
- **Stage 5 (Dispatch)**: Launch agents in parallel, collect ReviewFinding[]
- **Stage 6 (Aggregate)**: Merge findings, dedupe, gate decision, batch report

## Epic Structure (#302)

### Phase 1: Foundation

| Order | Issue | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | #337 | Zod schemas for config and pipeline data |
| 2 | #338 | Config data files (rules, composition, agents, domains) |
| 3 | #339 | Config loaders and validation tests |
| 4 | #341 | Migrate agents to structured JSON output |
| 5 | #340 | Pipeline stages (all 6 + orchestrator) |
| 6 | #342 | Skill definition + build-session-protocol integration |

### Future Phases

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| #308 | CI Integration — GitHub Action workflow |
| #310 | Review Agent Expansion — new agents + rules |
| #312 | Pipeline Review Stage — holistic end-to-end review |
| #313 | TDD Evaluation — test-driven development practices |

## Key Separation

Two distinct review levels, intentionally separated:

- **Build PR quality gate** (this scope): Automated, per-PR, invisible — part of build-session-protocol Phase 2
- **Pipeline review stage** (#312): Holistic end-to-end review before main merge — `work review` command
