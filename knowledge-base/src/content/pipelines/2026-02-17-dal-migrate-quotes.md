## Summary

Wave 2 of the DAL (Data Access Layer) migration plan. All `@/lib/mock-data` imports in the
Quotes route group were replaced with DAL calls following the patterns established in
`docs/plans/2026-02-16-dal-impl-plan.md`.

## What Was Migrated

### Server Pages (Pattern 1 & 3)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `quotes/page.tsx` | Made async; `Promise.all([getQuotes(), getCustomers()])` |
| `quotes/new/page.tsx` | Parallel fetch for all 5 QuoteForm dependencies; `getQuoteById()` for duplicate flow |
| `quotes/[id]/page.tsx` | DAL for quote, customer, artworks, garmentCatalog, colors |
| `quotes/[id]/edit/page.tsx` | DAL for quote + all 5 QuoteForm dependencies |

### Client Components (Pattern 4 — prop threading)

| Component | Removed Import | Props Added |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `QuoteForm.tsx` | `customers`, `colors`, `garmentCatalog`, `artworks` | 4 domain arrays + `dtfSheetTiers` |
| `QuotesDataTable.tsx` | `quotes`, `customers` | `quotes: Quote[]`, `customers: Customer[]` |
| `QuoteDetailView.tsx` | `garmentCatalog`, `colors` | `garmentCatalog: GarmentCatalog[]`, `colors: Color[]` |
| `QuoteReviewSheet.tsx` | (intermediary) | `garmentCatalog`, `colors` passed through |
| `DtfTabContent.tsx` | `dtfSheetTiers` | `dtfSheetTiers: DTFSheetTier[]` |

## Key Decisions

**State naming conflict**: `QuoteForm` had internal `customers` state that would clash with the new prop.
Renamed to `localCustomers`/`setLocalCustomers` to avoid shadowing.

**`QuoteFormInitialData` extraction**: The `initialData` prop shape was duplicated in
`new/page.tsx` and `[id]/edit/page.tsx`. Extracted as an exported type from `QuoteForm.tsx`.

**React Compiler deps**: After replacing module-level constants with props, useMemo dependency
arrays needed updating: `garmentCatalog`, `colors`, `artworks`, `allColors` added to
the appropriate memo deps to keep the React Compiler happy.

**`MatrixPeekSheet.tsx` deferred**: Still imports from `@/lib/mock-data-pricing`
(`allScreenPrintTemplates`, `tagTemplateMappings`). No settings DAL exists yet for pricing
templates. Filed as [GitHub Issue #417](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/issues/417).

## Verification

- `grep -r 'from.*"@/lib/mock-data"' app/(dashboard)/quotes/` → 0 results
- `npm run build` → clean
- `npm test` → 1027 passed
- `npm run lint` → 0 errors
