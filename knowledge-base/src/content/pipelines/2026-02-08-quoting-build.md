## Pull Requests

### [PR #13](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/pull/13) — feat: Build complete Quoting vertical

### [PR #20](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/pull/20) — feat: Quoting patch v3 — sticky bar, pricing, tooltips

Sticky bar redesign (single-row service type layout with inline color swatches), pricing formula with info tooltip in review view, artwork-derived color counts, tooltip dark mode + hover fixes, removed Edit Quote from review slide-out. CodeRabbit fixes (icon sizes). **Merged.**

## Pages Built

### /quotes — Quotes List

DataTable with status tab filters (All/Draft/Sent/Accepted/Declined/Revised), debounced search, column sorting, customer tag badges, row action dropdown (View/Edit/Copy as New/Send), empty state with CTA.

### /quotes/new — New Quote Form

Single-page form with 5 collapsible sections: Customer (combobox with tag badges) → Artwork (customer-tag-aware library) → Garments & Print (service type per item, per-location details with artwork assignment) → Pricing (discounts, shipping, tax, savings banner) → Notes. Sticky top bar with customer, artwork thumbnails, and grand total. "Review & Send" opens full-screen sheet.

### /quotes/[id] — Quote Detail

Read-only view with inline action header bar (Edit/Copy as New/Send/Email Preview). Service type badges, per-location color counts with artwork thumbnails, full pricing breakdown with discount visibility, artwork previews on garment swatches.

## Key Features

### Artwork System

Two-tier library: customer artwork library + per-quote curated set. Customer-tag-aware: new customers see upload dropzone, repeat see recently-used first, contract see full grid with search + tag filters. Per-location artwork assignment with inline picker. Artwork preview on garment color swatches.

### Flat Setup Fee Pricing

Screen-print: $40 flat per quote. Embroidery: $20 per line item. DTF: no setup fee. Full breakdown: garment cost + decoration cost + setup fees + discounts + shipping + tax = grand total. Contract customers get auto-applied 7% discount + free shipping. Savings banner with crossed-out original prices.

### Service Types & Customer Tags

3 service types per line item: screen-print, DTF, embroidery. 3 customer tags: new, repeat, contract. Tags drive smart defaults: auto-discounts, artwork library mode, shipping behavior. Per-location print details with color count and artwork assignment.

### Discount Model

Replaces flat price override. Discount types: manual, contract, volume. Each has label + amount. Add/remove in form. "You save $X!" banner when discounts exist. Contract pricing auto-applied when contract customer selected.

## Build Approach

### PR #13 — Initial Build (6 parallel agents)

Used git worktree for isolation and TeamCreate for parallel agent orchestration:

- **Phase A** (4 agents): schema-agent (schemas + mock data + 116 tests), swatch-agent (ColorSwatchPicker), combobox-agent (CustomerCombobox + AddCustomerModal), list-agent (QuotesDataTable + StatusBadge)
- **Phase B** (2 agents): form-agent (QuoteForm + LineItemRow + PricingSummary), detail-agent (quote detail + QuoteActions + EmailPreviewModal)

### PR #14 — Patch v2 (20 feedback items)

Addressed first-round feedback from 4Ink. Phased build (A through F) with targeted fixes:

- **Phase A**: New artwork schema, customer tags, service types, per-location details, discount model, shipping/tax, mock data overhaul, 2 bug fixes (duplicate + search)
- **Phase B**: PricingSummary redesign, DiscountRow, LineItemRow rewrite, CustomerCombobox tags
- **Phase C**: ArtworkLibrary, ArtworkUploadModal, ArtworkAssignmentPicker
- **Phase D**: CollapsibleSection, form restructure, customer-aware defaults
- **Phase E**: QuoteDetailView extraction, QuoteReviewSheet, detail page update
- **Phase F**: ArtworkPreview, discount visibility polish, sticky top bar, flat setup fee model, CodeRabbit review fixes (17 items: icon sizes, a11y, design tokens, lint)

### PR #20 — Patch v3 (sticky bar, pricing, tooltips)

Iterative polish session focused on sticky bar UX, tooltip behavior, and pricing clarity:

- **Sticky bar redesign**: Collapsed multi-row service type layout into single inline row with color swatches + qty labels separated by pipe (`[swatch][swatch] 455 Screen Print | [swatch] 700 DTF`). Added artwork thumbnail icons, discount badge, notes icon with tooltips.
- **Tooltip system**: Fixed dark mode styling (bg-elevated), hover/flickering bugs (shared TooltipProvider, sideOffset gap, pointer-events-none on closing state), swatch tooltips with garment + sizes + print locations, artwork tooltips with large preview images.
- **Pricing formula**: Review view line items now show `($13.50 x 562 qty) + $40 setup = $7,627.00` with info icon tooltip explaining per-unit cost breakdown and setup fee rates per service type.
- **Color count from artwork**: Removed manual color count input. Color count auto-derived from assigned artwork. Resets when artwork removed or customer changed.
- **Review slide-out**: Added grand total to sticky header. Removed Edit Quote button (close via X or click-away).
- **CodeRabbit fixes**: Icon sizes (size-12 → size-6) in empty state placeholders.

## Deferred Tech Debt

Tracked as GitHub issues for future sessions:

- [#15](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/issues/15) — Migrate forms to React Hook Form + Zod (QuoteForm, ArtworkUploadModal, AddCustomerModal)
- [#16](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/issues/16) — Replace local LineItemRow interfaces with schema-derived types
- [#17](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/issues/17) — Sync garment category filter with URL query params
- [#18](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/issues/18) — Extract shared formatCurrency/formatDate to lib/utils

## Next Steps

1. Run quality-gate audit on all 3 screens
2. Demo to 4Ink owner, collect feedback
3. Iterate on feedback (target: 8+ rating on Clarity, Speed, Polish, Value)
4. Address deferred tech debt (#15-#18) as needed
5. Move to Invoicing vertical
