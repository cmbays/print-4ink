## Summary

Audited Streams A, B, and C of the Pipeline Architecture Redesign (#192). Prior sessions had completed the majority of the work — this session identified the remaining gap and resolved it.

## Audit Results

### Stream A: Config Migration — ✅ Complete (prior sessions)

- `config/pipeline-types.json` — exists and correct (renamed from `workflows.json`)
- `config/stages.json` — 8 canonical slugs: `research`, `interview`, `shape`, `breadboard`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `wrap-up`
- `config/verticals.json` — eliminated (file does not exist)
- No source-code references to `verticals.json` or `workflows.json` (only historical docs)

### Stream B: KB Schema Migration — ✅ Complete (prior sessions + this session)

- `knowledge-base/src/content.config.ts` — fully migrated to `pipelineName: z.string()` and `pipelineId: z.string().optional()`
- All 80 pipeline frontmatter files — already use `pipelineName:` (not old `vertical:` field)
- **Fix this session**: `config/products.json` was missing `garments` and `screens` products, causing KB build failure. These are real dashboard routes (`/garments`, `/screens`). Added both entries.

### Stream C: KB Page Updates — ✅ Complete (prior sessions)

- `[pipeline].astro` — dynamically derives from unique `pipelineName` values, no hardcoded enums
- `index.astro` — derives pipeline counts and filters from content
- `lib/utils.ts` — fully config-driven, no hardcoded vertical references

## Change Made

Added `garments` and `screens` to `config/products.json`:

```json
{ "slug": "garments", "label": "Garments", ... },
{ "slug": "screens", "label": "Screens", ... }
```

## Verification

- `npm run kb:build` — ✅ 198 pages built, 194 indexed, 0 errors
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — ✅ no type errors
- `work help` — ✅ shell still functions
