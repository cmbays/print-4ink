## What Was Built

Three focused integration features that surface screen data where it matters in the workflow, rather than only on the standalone `/screens` page.

### 1. Helper Foundation

- `getScreensByJobId(jobId)` — filters mock screens by job ID
- `getActiveCustomerScreens(customerId)` — wraps `deriveScreensFromJobs` for future reclaim-aware filtering
- 6 new tests covering known jobs, unknown IDs, and screen states

### 2. Quote Screen Reuse (QuoteForm + PricingSummary)

- When a customer with completed jobs is selected, a green banner shows the count of reusable screens
- Banner only appears when at least one line item uses `screen-print` service type
- Toggle enables "screen reuse" mode which waives the $40 setup fee
- PricingSummary displays the discount line with a `screens` badge
- Discount is included in the savings banner total
- State resets when customer changes

### 3. Job Detail Screens (JobDetailsSection)

- Screens linked to the current job display between Print Locations and Complexity sections
- Each screen shows mesh count, emulsion type, and a color-coded burn status badge
- Uses existing `BURN_STATUS_LABELS` constants and design system badge patterns
