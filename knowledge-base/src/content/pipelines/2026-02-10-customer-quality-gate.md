## Audit Summary

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| FAILs Fixed | 4 |
| WARNs Fixed | 5 |
| Files Changed | 11 |
| Tests Passing | 264 |

## Audit Methodology

Ran 5 parallel audit subagents simultaneously to maximize coverage:

- **Visual Audit: Customer List** — Checked layout, responsive design, design token usage, interactive states
- **Visual Audit: Customer Detail** — Checked all 7 tabs, header, badges, timeline, tables, modals
- **Scope Coverage** — Verified every CORE feature from the scope definition has a corresponding UI
- **Cross-Vertical Navigation** — Tested Customer <-> Quoting links, URL params, data flow
- **Playwright Verification** — End-to-end browser testing of the full customer flow

## Fixes Applied

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | FAIL | `bg-bg-elevated` invalid Tailwind class (3 files) | Changed to `bg-elevated` |
| 2 | FAIL | "New Quote" sends `?customer=` but quotes/new doesn't read it | Added param consumption + pre-fill logic |
| 3 | FAIL | `?from=` vs `?duplicate=` param mismatch | Changed to `?duplicate=` to match |
| 4 | FAIL | Customer name on QuoteDetailView not clickable | Wrapped in `<Link>` to `/customers/:id` |
| 5 | WARN | AddContact/AddGroup buttons not wired | Imported sheets, added state + onClick handlers |
| 6 | WARN | Sort headers missing focus-visible rings | Added `focus-visible:ring-2` to all sort buttons |
| 7 | WARN | Table rows not keyboard-accessible | Added `tabIndex`, Enter/Space, `role="link"` |
| 8 | WARN | CustomerDetailsPanel missing referrer lookup | Threaded `customers` prop through Tabs |
| 9 | WARN | Future dates show "-10 days ago" | Fixed both `formatDaysAgo()` and `relativeDate()` |
| 10 | BONUS | CopyButton missing focus-visible ring | Added `focus-visible:ring-2` |

## Playwright Verification

After applying all fixes, verified end-to-end in the browser:

- **Customer List** — Mobile cards render with correct `bg-elevated` background
- **Customer Detail** — "Last Order: In 9 days" (future date fix confirmed)
- **Contacts Tab** — "Add Contact" button opens sheet with all fields (Name, Email, Phone, Role, Group, Primary)
- **New Quote Flow** — `/quotes/new?customer=...` pre-fills the customer in the combobox
- **Activity Timeline** — Future dates show "In X days" (not "-X days ago")

## Pull Request

[PR #33](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/pull/33) — `session/0210-customer-quality-gate` → `main`

## What's Next

- **Iterate** based on feedback
- **Move to Invoicing vertical** after validation
