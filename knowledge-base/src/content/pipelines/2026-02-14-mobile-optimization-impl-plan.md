## Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the mobile optimization vertical, translating the breadboard's 25 build steps into 25 bite-sized tasks with exact file paths, code snippets, acceptance criteria, and commit points. Three research agents explored the codebase in parallel to identify existing responsive patterns and gaps.

## Key Findings from Codebase Research

### What Already Exists
- **3 of 4 list views** (Jobs, Invoices, Customers) already have `md:hidden` mobile card views
- **Job detail** already has responsive grid (`grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3`)
- **`sheet.tsx`** component available for drawers/bottom sheets
- **`dialog.tsx`** already has mobile-friendly `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)]`
- **`CapacitySummaryBar`** exists on the board
- **`NotesFeed`** component exists for job notes
- Framer Motion already installed (for swipe gestures)

### What's Missing (Zero Responsive Infrastructure)
- No mobile design tokens (`--mobile-nav-height`, `--mobile-touch-target`, etc.)
- No `useIsMobile` hook or viewport detection
- No responsive classes on dashboard layout (`grid-cols-4` hardcoded)
- No bottom tab bar, mobile header, or mobile drawer
- No bottom sheet component
- Sidebar fixed at `w-60` with no responsive hiding
- `touch-none` on Kanban drag cards conflicts with mobile scrolling
- Quotes list is the only list missing mobile cards

## Plan Structure

| Sprint | Tasks | Duration | Focus |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| Sprint 1 | Tasks 1-9 | ~1 week | Foundation: tokens, hooks, BottomTabBar, MobileDrawer, MobileHeader, layout integration, touch audit, BottomSheet, MobileCardList |
| Sprint 2 | Tasks 10-14 | ~1 week | High-Value: MobileKanbanBoard, CapacitySummary, NoteCapture with side effects, MobileDashboard, LaneSelector |
| Sprint 3 | Tasks 15-18 | ~1 week | Lists + Forms: Quotes mobile cards, polish existing cards, MobileFilterSheet, form mobile layouts |
| Sprint 4 | Tasks 19-25 | ~1 week | Detail Views + Polish: BottomActionBar, all detail mobile layouts, FullScreenModal, desktop regression |

## New Components (~15 total)

| Component | File Path | Sprint |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `navigation.ts` | `lib/constants/navigation.ts` | 1 |
| `BottomTabBar` | `components/layout/bottom-tab-bar.tsx` | 1 |
| `MobileDrawer` | `components/layout/mobile-drawer.tsx` | 1 |
| `MobileHeader` | `components/layout/mobile-header.tsx` | 1 |
| `MobileShell` | `components/layout/mobile-shell.tsx` | 1 |
| `BottomSheet` | `components/ui/bottom-sheet.tsx` | 1 |
| `MobileCardList` | `components/ui/mobile-card-list.tsx` | 1 |
| `MobileKanbanBoard` | `app/(dashboard)/jobs/board/_components/MobileKanbanBoard.tsx` | 2 |
| `MobileLaneTabBar` | `app/(dashboard)/jobs/board/_components/MobileLaneTabBar.tsx` | 2 |
| `BlockReasonSheet` | `components/features/BlockReasonSheet.tsx` | 2 |
| `CapacitySummary` | `components/features/CapacitySummary.tsx` | 2 |
| `NoteCapture` | `components/features/NoteCapture.tsx` | 2 |
| `LaneSelector` | `components/features/LaneSelector.tsx` | 2 |
| `MobileFilterSheet` | `components/features/MobileFilterSheet.tsx` | 3 |
| `BottomActionBar` | `components/layout/bottom-action-bar.tsx` | 4 |
| `FullScreenModal` | `components/ui/full-screen-modal.tsx` | 4 |

## Architect Review

Two independent architect agents reviewed the plan and identified 20 findings (4 critical, 12 important, 4 nice-to-have). All critical and important fixes were applied:

- **Server component preservation**: Dashboard layout stays server component; extracted `MobileShell` client wrapper
- **Color class correction**: `text-text-muted`/`text-text-secondary` → `text-muted-foreground` (~20 instances)
- **Type system alignment**: Board uses `JobCard` from `board-card.ts`, not raw `Job` schema
- **Missing affordances added**: FAB, section toggle, quote cards, scratch notes, BlockReasonSheet
- **ARIA fix**: `<nav>` + `aria-current="page"` instead of `role="tablist"`
- **Design standards updated**: CLAUDE.md color token table fixed, z-index scale added, mobile patterns documented

## Risk Areas

1. **Mobile Kanban swipe (Task 10)** — Highest complexity; may need a spike for touch gesture handling with Framer Motion
2. **iOS Safari scroll locking** — Bottom sheets may need body scroll lock to prevent background scroll
3. **Mobile keyboard handling** — NoteCapture textarea may push content on iOS virtual keyboard
4. **BottomActionBar z-index (Task 19)** — Uses z-40 to layer below BottomTabBar (z-50)
