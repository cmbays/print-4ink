### Commands Not Testable (require Zellij + non-nested Claude)

- `work research <vertical>` (creates Zellij tab + launches Claude)
- `work build <manifest>` (generates KDL + launches Zellij)
- `work resume <topic>` (launches `claude --resume`)
- `work next` (launches `claude -p`)
- Ada 1:1 check-in (requires interactive Claude session)

These require manual testing in a Zellij terminal session.

## Bugs Filed

| Issue                                                   | Title                                                            | Severity                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [#105](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/issues/105) | `work status/list` exit code 1 when no dev servers running       | Medium — `_work_show_infra()` for loop leaves exit code 1 |
| [#106](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/issues/106) | Phase commands reject `mobile-optimization` and `meta` verticals | Medium — hardcoded whitelist out of sync with KB schema   |
| [#107](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/issues/107) | Worktree limit check off-by-one                                  | Low — `>` should be `>=`                                  |

All three are quick fixes (1-2 lines each). Could be addressed in a single patch PR.

## Quality Assessment

### Architecture

The four-layer separation (git worktrees, Claude sessions, Zellij workspace, KB docs) is clean and well-implemented. The session registry JSON file is the cross-reference glue connecting all layers.

**Strengths:**

- CWD architecture solved the worktree-deletion-kills-Claude problem elegantly
- Registry CRUD uses advisory locking for concurrent safety
- KDL generation from YAML manifests enables one-touch build wave launches
- Phase commands automatically wire skills/agents per pipeline stage
- Prompt interpolation is shell-native (no sed delimiter issues)

**Concerns:**

- `yq` dependency for manifest parsing is not auto-installed
- No automated tests for shell functions (manual testing only)
- Registry doesn't auto-capture Claude session IDs (manual step)
- Ada personality files not yet populated (empty memory files)

### Code Quality

| Category       | Assessment                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Error handling | Good — all commands validate args, show clear errors       |
| Documentation  | Excellent — `work help` is comprehensive with examples     |
| Consistency    | Good — naming conventions followed throughout              |
| Safety         | Good — confirmation prompt on destructive `work clean`     |
| Modularity     | Good — libraries split into registry.sh + kdl-generator.sh |
| Edge cases     | Fair — some off-by-one and whitelist sync issues found     |

### Skill & Agent Quality

All 8 agents follow the same format: YAML frontmatter (name, description, skills, tools) + markdown system prompt. The two new review agents (finance-sme, build-reviewer) are read-only and produce structured audit reports with severity levels.

The 6 new skills all follow the SKILL.md format with trigger, prerequisites, process, and tips sections. Build-session-protocol is the most critical — it defines the 6-phase completion flow that every build session follows.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the 3 bugs** (#105, #106, #107) — simple 1-2 line patches
2. **Add `yq` to TECH_STACK.md** — it's a build dependency now
3. **Manual Zellij test** — the commands that create Zellij tabs need testing in a real terminal
4. **Auto-capture Claude session IDs** — investigate if the CLI emits the session ID on startup
5. **Shell function testing** — consider bats-core for automated shell testing in future
