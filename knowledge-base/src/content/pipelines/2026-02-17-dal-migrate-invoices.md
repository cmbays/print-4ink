## What Was Built

Migrated all 7 mock-data import sites in the invoices route group to use the Data Access Layer (DAL). This is Wave 2, Task 2.3 of the [DAL Architecture plan](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/blob/main/docs/plans/2026-02-16-dal-impl-plan.md).

**Epic:** #360 (DAL Architecture) | **Issue:** #158 | **PR:** #412

## Files Changed

| File | Pattern | Change |
|------|---------|--------|
| `invoices/page.tsx` | Pattern 1 | Made async, `Promise.all([getInvoices(), getCustomers()])`, passes to children |
| `invoices/[id]/page.tsx` | Pattern 2 | 4 array ops → `getInvoiceById`, `getCustomerById`, `getInvoicePayments`, `getInvoiceCreditMemos` |
| `invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx` | Pattern 2 | `invoices.find()` → `getInvoiceById`, fetches customers+sourceQuote for form |
| `invoices/new/page.tsx` | Pattern 2 | New fetch: customers, sourceQuote, invoiceCount → `initialInvoiceNumber` |
| `InvoiceStatsBar.tsx` | Pattern 4 | Accepts `invoices: Invoice[]` prop |
| `InvoicesDataTable.tsx` | Pattern 4 | Accepts `customers: Customer[]` prop |
| `InvoiceForm.tsx` | Pattern 4 | Replaces `mockCustomers`, `mockQuotes`, `mockInvoices` with props |

## Key Decisions

### Invoice number generation moved server-side

`InvoiceForm` previously called `generateInvoiceNumber()` which used `mockInvoices.length + 1`. After migration, `new/page.tsx` fetches `getInvoices()`, computes `INV-NNNN`, and passes it as `initialInvoiceNumber` prop. In edit mode, `initialData.invoiceNumber` is used directly (no prop needed).

### `quoteId` prop removed from `InvoiceForm`

The form previously accepted `quoteId?: string` and resolved the quote from `mockQuotes` inside a `useMemo`. After migration, parent pages (`new/page.tsx`, `edit/page.tsx`) resolve the quote server-side via `getQuoteById()` and pass the resolved `Quote | null` as `sourceQuote` prop.

### `InvoiceForm` useMemo deps updated

`customerOptions` useMemo dependency updated from `[]` to `[customers]` to correctly track the prop.

## Self-Review Findings

| # | Severity | Finding | Action |
|---|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | warning | `getInvoices` unused import in `edit/page.tsx` | Fixed immediately |
| 2 | major | Duplicate "not found" block across `[id]` and `[id]/edit` pages | Filed #409 |
| 3 | major | Dead `<Suspense>` boundary — data pre-fetched, fallback can never fire | Filed #410 |
| 4 | warning | `sm:grid-cols-4` in `InvoiceStatsBar` should be `md:` | Filed #411 |

## Verification

```bash
grep -r "from.*mock-data" app/(dashboard)/invoices/
# → zero results

npm run build   # ✓ clean
npm test        # ✓ 1027 tests pass
npx tsc --noEmit  # ✓ no errors
```
