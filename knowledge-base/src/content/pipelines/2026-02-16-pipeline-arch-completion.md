## Summary

Final session for the pipeline architecture redesign (#192). Completed the three remaining migration streams and verified zero stale references across the codebase.

## What Was Done

### Stream A: Config Migration (verified clean)

- `config/verticals.json` confirmed deleted (Wave 0)
- `config/workflows.json` confirmed renamed to `config/pipeline-types.json` (Wave 0)
- Full codebase audit: zero stale imports or references to deleted configs
- Only mentions are in historical planning/research docs (expected)

### Stream B: KB Schema Migration (completed)

- Migrated 65 pipeline docs: `pipeline:` → `pipelineName:` (57 files renamed, 7 already current, 1 moved from sessions/)
- Normalized 18 stage slugs: `breadboarding` → `breadboard` (10), `implementation-planning` → `plan` (5), `shaping` → `shape` (1), `learnings` → `wrap-up` (2)
- Removed `z.preprocess` backward-compat wrapper from `content.config.ts`
- Removed `stageSlugMap`, `normalizeStage()`, and old slug aliases from `lib/utils.ts`
- Schema now uses plain `z.object` with `z.enum(pipelineStageSlugs)` directly

### Stream C: KB Page Updates (verified clean)

- `[pipeline].astro` uses direct equality (`s.data.stage === stage`) instead of `normalizeStage()`
- Product and tool pages updated: "pipeline sessions" → "pipeline docs"
- All pages derive routes from content dynamically — no config-backed vertical enums

## Merge Conflict Resolution

PR #295 had conflicts with main where 5 files had been renamed `pipeline: meta` → `pipeline: devx` on main while we renamed `pipeline:` → `pipelineName:`. Resolution: `pipelineName: devx` (both changes applied). One new file from main (`dtf-wave4-canvas.md`) was migrated to new frontmatter format during merge.

## Verification

| Check                               | Result                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| KB build (`npm run build`)          | 153 pages, zero errors |
| TypeScript (`npx tsc --noEmit`)     | Clean                  |
| Stale `pipeline:` field             | 0 files                |
| Old stage slugs in frontmatter      | 0 files                |
| `normalizeStage` references         | 0 files                |
| `stageSlugMap` references           | 0 files                |
| `verticals.json` references in code | 0 files                |
| `workflows.json` references in code | 0 files                |
| Shell (`work help`)                 | Works                  |

## Review

Two-agent parallel review:

1. **Code quality**: APPROVE — no broken imports, no missed backward-compat code, CSS classes validated as KB-specific tokens
2. **Frontmatter completeness**: APPROVE — all 65 files have all 11 required fields, all values valid against canonical configs

## Issue #192 Closure

All 6 implementation streams from #192 are now complete:

| Stream               | Status           | PRs               |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| A: Config            | Complete         | #230              |
| B: KB Schema         | Complete         | #295              |
| C: KB Pages          | Complete         | #295              |
| D: Work Orchestrator | Complete         | #230, #286        |
| E: Skills Update     | Complete         | Verified via grep |
| F: Research Skills   | Deferred to #201 | —                 |
