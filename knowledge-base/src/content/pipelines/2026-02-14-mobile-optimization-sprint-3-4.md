## Context

Mobile Optimization Sprint 1 (PR #101) established the navigation shell — BottomTabBar, MobileDrawer, MobileHeader, 8 design tokens, and the responsive CSS-first pattern. Sprint 2 (PR #114) adapted high-value screens: responsive dashboard, table-to-card conversions for quotes/jobs/customers/invoices, and Kanban board mobile gestures.

Sprint 3+4 completes the mobile build phase with shared interaction components, form layout adaptations, and detail view mobile layouts across all 4 entity types.

## What Was Built

### Wave 1 — Shared Components (4 parallel agents)

1. **MobileFilterSheet** (`components/features/MobileFilterSheet.tsx`) — Configurable bottom sheet for sort/filter operations with chip toggle buttons. Accepts `sortOptions` and `filterGroups` as props, uses conditional render (`{open && <Sheet />}`) for automatic state reset on close. Focus-visible rings on all interactive elements.

2. **BottomActionBar** (`components/layout/bottom-action-bar.tsx`) — Fixed bottom bar positioned above BottomTabBar at z-40. Uses `bottom-[calc(var(--mobile-nav-height)+env(safe-area-inset-bottom,0px))]` for precise positioning. Hidden on desktop via `md:hidden`. Renders children as action buttons.

3. **FullScreenModal** (`components/ui/full-screen-modal.tsx`) — Mobile-first modal that renders as full-viewport Sheet on mobile, standard Dialog on desktop. Uses `useIsMobile()` hook for JS-based responsive behavior (one of the few cases where CSS-first isn't sufficient — conditional Dialog/Sheet rendering requires JS). Includes sr-only DialogHeader for Radix accessibility compliance.

4. **Sticky Form Actions** — QuoteForm and InvoiceForm action buttons converted to `sticky bottom-0 z-10` bars on mobile. Cancel button uses `variant="link"` to save horizontal space. All buttons enforce `min-h-(--mobile-touch-target)` touch targets.

### Wave 2 — Detail View Mobile Layouts (4 parallel agents)

5. **Job Detail** (`jobs/[id]/page.tsx`) — Mobile tabbed layout with 3 tabs (Overview, Tasks, Notes) using `md:hidden` / `hidden md:grid`. Lane-aware BottomActionBar: hidden when job is "done", shows "Unblock" when "blocked", shows "Move Lane" + "Add Note" otherwise.

6. **Quote Detail** (`quotes/_components/QuoteDetailView.tsx`) — Status-aware BottomActionBar rendering contextual actions: accepted quotes get "View Jobs" + "Create Invoice", drafts get "Edit" + "Send", all others get "Copy as New". Container uses `pb-20 md:pb-0` spacer pattern for bottom bar clearance.

7. **Invoice Detail** (`invoices/_components/InvoiceDetailView.tsx`) — Status-aware BottomActionBar with `hasActions` guard to prevent rendering an empty bar. Computes boolean conditions (`canEdit`, `canSend`, `canRecordPayment`, `canSendReminder`) and derives `showBottomBar` from their disjunction.

8. **Customer Detail** (`customers/[id]/page.tsx`) — 9-tab mobile bar with `overflow-x-auto scrollbar-none` for horizontal scrolling. Sticky header with customer name, touch targets on all interactive elements.

### Wave 3 — Review & Fixes (3 review agents)

Three specialized review agents (code quality, silent failure, design system) found 9 issues. All 9 were fixed:

- Missing touch target on Job Detail back button
- Job BottomActionBar not lane-aware (always showed Move Lane)
- Quote status handling not explicitly documented (comment said "sent" but covered 4 statuses)
- Invoice `showBottomBar` used status exclusion instead of `hasActions` guard
- FullScreenModal missing sr-only DialogHeader for screen readers
- MobileFilterSheet missing focus-visible rings
- Spacer pattern inconsistency (separate div vs container padding)
- QuoteForm/InvoiceForm merge conflict with `shadow-brutal` tokens
- Minor: sort/filter chip styling alignment

### Filed Issues (6 remaining items)

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| #151 | Unit tests for mobile shared components |
| #152 | Integrate MobileFilterSheet into list views |
| #153 | Extract hardcoded toast messages to constants |
| #154 | Fix pre-existing lint errors (garments/page.tsx, PowerModeGrid) |
| #155 | Customer detail tab grouping for 9-tab bar |
| #156 | Mobile scroll-to-error on form validation |

## Architecture Decisions

### CSS-first responsive vs JS-based
Maintained the CSS-first pattern (`md:hidden` / `hidden md:block`) for all show/hide responsive behavior. FullScreenModal is the sole exception — it needs `useIsMobile()` because it conditionally renders entirely different component trees (Dialog vs Sheet), which can't be achieved with CSS display toggling.

### BottomActionBar z-index positioning
Placed at z-40 (between content z-10 and navigation z-50). The `bottom` offset calculation uses `calc(var(--mobile-nav-height) + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` to sit precisely above the BottomTabBar on notched devices.

### Status/lane-aware action bars
Rather than generic "show all actions" bars, each entity's BottomActionBar renders contextually appropriate actions. This follows the "progressive disclosure" UX principle — don't show actions that aren't applicable to the current state.

### hasActions guard pattern
Invoice detail computes individual action booleans (`canEdit`, `canSend`, etc.) then derives `showBottomBar = hasActions` from their disjunction. This prevents rendering an empty bar if a future status has no applicable actions, and is more maintainable than status-exclusion lists.

## Technical Details

- **PR**: #148 (squash-merged as `a3e70ba`)
- **Files changed**: 11 (+608/-87 lines)
- **Commits**: 4 (Wave 1, Wave 2, review fixes, merge conflict resolution)
- **Tests**: 516 passing (no regressions)
- **Build**: 17 static pages, clean tsc
- **Merge conflict**: Resolved shadow token drift — adopted `shadow-brutal` / `shadow-brutal-sm` from main

## Mobile Optimization Completion

With this PR, all 25 tasks from `docs/plans/2026-02-14-mobile-optimization-implementation.md` are complete:

| Sprint | Tasks | PR | Focus |
|--------|-------|----|-------|
| Sprint 1 | 1-9 | #101 | Navigation shell (BottomTabBar, MobileDrawer, tokens) |
| Sprint 2 | 10-16 | #114 | High-value screens (dashboard, list views, Kanban) |
| Sprint 3+4 | 17-25 | #148 | Shared components, forms, detail views |

The mobile optimization build phase is complete. Remaining polish items (#151-#156) are tracked as GitHub issues for future sprints.
