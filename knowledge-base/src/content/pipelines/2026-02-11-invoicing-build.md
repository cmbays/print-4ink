## Build Summary

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| New Files | 30 |
| Modified Files | 8 |
| Tests Passing | 314 |
| Quality Gate | 10/10 |

## Build Phases

### Phase 0 — Data Foundation

Zod schemas for invoices and credit memos. Status state machine (`isValidStatusTransition`), financial calculators with big.js precision, mock data (8 invoices, 11 payments, 2 credit memos). All math uses `money()` / `round2()` / `toNumber()` — zero floating-point.

### Phase 1 — List Page

Stats bar (outstanding, overdue, paid this month, avg days to pay), smart view tabs (All/Draft/Outstanding/Overdue/Paid), data table with sort, search, batch ops, desktop table + mobile cards, and overdue badge with pulse animation.

### Phase 2 — Form + Detail View

Full invoice form (customer, line items, pricing summary, deposit, payment terms), detail view with payment ledger, reminder timeline, change diff panel, audit log, and context-aware action buttons per status.

### Phase 3 — Overlays + Edit

Record Payment sheet, Send Reminder modal, Void Invoice dialog (destructive, permanent), Create Credit Memo modal (line-item selection, bounded by invoice total), and edit page (draft-only guard).

### Phase 4 — Integration Points

Sidebar navigation (Receipt icon), Customer detail invoices tab, Quote detail "Create Invoice" button (accepted quotes only), and all cross-vertical navigation wiring.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### big.js for All Financial Arithmetic

Every monetary calculation goes through `lib/helpers/money.ts`. Schema invariants use `Big.eq()` for exact comparison. IEEE 754 floating-point is never used for money — not even for simple addition.

### Status State Machine

`isValidStatusTransition()` enforces: draft→sent→partial→paid, with void as terminal from any non-paid state. All UI actions check transitions before enabling buttons.

### Immutability After Send

Edit page redirects to detail view for non-draft invoices. InvoiceForm rejects non-draft mode. No backdoor to modify sent/partial/paid invoices.

### Overdue Is Computed, Never Stored

Single `computeIsOverdue()` function used everywhere (stats, table, detail, badge). Compares `dueDate < today AND balanceDue > 0 AND status in [sent, partial]`.

### Conditional Rendering for Dialog State

React 19 ESLint forbids `setState` in effects. All sheet/dialog components use conditional rendering (`{show && <Component />}`) so React unmounts/remounts, naturally resetting useState hooks.

## Quality Gate Results

| # | Category | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Visual Hierarchy | Pass |
| 2 | Spacing & Layout | Pass |
| 3 | Typography | Pass |
| 4 | Color Usage | Pass |
| 5 | Interactive States | Pass |
| 6 | Icons | Pass |
| 7 | Motion & Animation | Pass |
| 8 | Empty & Error States | Pass |
| 9 | Accessibility | Pass |
| 10 | Jobs Filter (Density) | Pass |

Fixes applied during quality gate: `font-bold`→`font-semibold` (1), `role="alert"` additions (2), `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons (3), empty state icon sizes to `size-12` (2), search no-results now quotes query.

## Mock Data Coverage

| Invoice | Status | Total | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| INV-0001 | Paid | $765 | 2 payments (check + square) |
| INV-0002 | Sent/Overdue | $2,614 | Past due 27 days, 1 reminder |
| INV-0003 | Draft | $855 | Deposit requested $427.50 |
| INV-0004 | Paid | $1,850 | Holiday merch, 2 payments |
| INV-0005 | Partial | $840 | Deposit received, due in 4d |
| INV-0006 | Sent | $3,200 | Wholesale, due in 17d |
| INV-0007 | Partial | $2,100 | ACH + Zelle, due in 9d |
| INV-0008 | Void | $450 | Customer cancelled |

Plus 11 payment records and 2 credit memos covering check, cash, square, venmo, zelle, and ACH methods.

## Lessons Learned

### big.js Is Non-Negotiable for Financial UI

Even "display-only" components that compute stats (sums, averages) must use big.js. Floating-point errors compound across 8 invoices with multi-payment ledgers. The `money()` wrapper makes it painless.

### Quality Gate Catches Real Issues

The 10-category audit found 8 fixable issues across typography (`font-bold`), accessibility (`role="alert"`, `aria-hidden`), and empty states (icon sizing). All fixed in 3 commits with zero regressions.

### Conditional Rendering Beats useEffect Reset

React 19 ESLint flags `setState` in effects. The pattern `{show && <Sheet />}` is cleaner — unmount/remount naturally resets all hooks. Applied to RecordPaymentSheet, SendReminderModal, VoidInvoiceDialog, and CreateCreditMemoModal.
