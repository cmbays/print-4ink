## Summary

Applied the R x S shaping methodology to design a hierarchical color preference system for Screen Print Pro. Defined 9 requirements (R0-R8), explored 3 competing shapes, selected Shape A (entity-owned favorites with live inheritance) via fit check, and resolved the brand detail view spike. This shaping feeds directly into the breadboard at `docs/breadboards/color-preference-breadboard.md`.

## Requirements (9 top-level)

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| R0 | Visual color filtering — swatches not text | Core goal |
| R1 | Honest garment card colors — favorites + count | Must-have |
| R2 | Three-level favorites hierarchy (global, brand, customer) | Must-have |
| R3 | Safe inheritance behavior (additive auto-propagation, removal confirmation) | Must-have |
| R4 | Non-technical usability — single-layer thinking | Must-have |
| R5 | Graceful degradation — each level optional | Must-have |
| R6 | Entity-context editing — edit where the entity lives | Must-have |
| R7 | Configurable swatch display — flat/grouped | Nice-to-have |
| R8 | Full palette access via detail drawer | Must-have |

## Three Shapes Explored

### Shape A: Entity-Owned Favorites with Live Inheritance (SELECTED)

Each entity owns its own `favoriteColorIds[]`. Inheritance computed at read time by walking the hierarchy (global → brand → customer). Figma-model live inheritance: additions auto-propagate, removals require confirmation. Beth Meyer toggle at each level for inherit/customize.

7 parts (A1-A7) covering visual filter, favorites-first cards, global/brand/customer management, inheritance engine, and removal dialog.

### Shape B: Centralized Preference Store (REJECTED)

Single `preferences` table with scoped entries (`entityType`, `entityId`, `scope`, `preferenceType`, `valueIds[]`). Query engine resolves applicable preferences by walking scope hierarchy.

**Rejected**: Over-abstract. Exposes implementation concepts that don't match how shop owners think. "Our Gildan favorites" becomes a multi-column query — the indirection adds cognitive load without user benefit.

### Shape C: Cascading Profiles with CSS-style Override (REJECTED)

Each level has a preference profile with specificity rules. Most-specific profile wins. Per-property override tracking with cascade resolution.

**Rejected**: Too complex for non-technical users. Selective propagation (R3.4) breaks the cascade model — you can't selectively remove from some children without per-entity override rules that compound specificity. Needing a debug view is a usability failure.

## Fit Check

| Req | A | B | C |
|-----|---|---|---|
| R0 | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| R1 | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| R2 | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| R3 | Pass | Pass | Fail |
| R4 | Pass | Fail | Fail |
| R5 | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| R6 | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| R7 | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| R8 | Pass | Pass | Pass |

Shape A is the only shape that passes all requirements.

## Key Decisions

| # | Decision | Outcome |
|---|----------|---------|
| D1 | Data model approach | Entity-owned (A) over centralized (B) and cascading (C) |
| D2 | Inheritance model | Live inheritance with override preservation (Figma model) |
| D3 | Inheritance control UX | Beth Meyer toggle (binary: inherit/customize) |
| D4 | Favorite indication | Section grouping, not star overlays |
| D5 | Propagation asymmetry | Additive = auto, removal = confirm |
| D6 | Removal UX | Three-option dialog + progressive disclosure |
| D7 | Swatch display default | Flat grid (Sammar-style, Gary's preference) |
| D8 | Where each level lives | Global→Settings, Brand→Garments drawer, Customer→Detail tab |
| D9 | Brand detail view | Drawer in garments section (consistent with garment detail) |
| D10 | Customer axes | Independent (colors, brands, garments — each optional) |
| D11 | Level requirement | None — each level optional, graceful degradation |
| D12 | Auto-propagation | Configurable setting, default yes |

## Spike: Brand Detail View (A4.1)

Investigated how a brand detail view integrates into garments since no sub-routing or brand schema exists. Resolved: **brand detail drawer** accessed via brand name click, consistent with the garment detail drawer pattern (P1.1).

Entry points: (1) brand name on garment cards, (2) brand name in toolbar when filter active, (3) future "Brands" sub-tab.
