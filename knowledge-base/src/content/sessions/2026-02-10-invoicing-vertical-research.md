## 1. Executive Summary

**The invoicing vertical is the natural next step for Screen Print Pro.** The existing quote schema already contains 90% of the data an invoice needs. The competitive landscape reveals fragmented solutions where every platform excels in 1-2 areas but has significant blind spots. Our opportunity: production-aware invoicing that feels as simple as Printavo on day one but grows with the shop.

### Key Findings Across All Research Tracks

**Industry:** Screen printing invoicing is well-established but poorly served. The quote-to-cash pipeline (Quote → Deposit → Production → Final Invoice) is standard. Shops charge for garments, print costs per color/location, screen setup, art, rush fees, and shipping. 50% deposit is the norm. The #1 pain point is chasing late payments — 87% of invoices are paid after the due date.

**Competitive:** PrintLife has strong supplier integration but no multi-user support. PrintLife leads on supplier catalog integration (S&S, SanMar, Alphabroder) and has a unique ink change-out guardrail. But it's single-user only with no G2/Capterra presence. Printavo dominates small shops but users outgrow it. shopVOX has the deepest features but is overly complex. No one nails both simplicity and power.

**Integration:** Existing schemas are 90% ready for invoicing. The quote schema's line items, customer payment terms, tax-exempt fields, and pricing tiers map directly to invoice fields. Only two new schema files needed: `invoice.ts` and `credit-memo.ts`. Five existing verticals (Quotes, Customers, Artwork, Screen Room, Production) connect to invoicing. Four future verticals (Jobs, Reporting, Shipping, Inventory) consume invoice data.

**UX:** Mirror the existing quote form pattern. The invoice creation UX should use the same collapsible section form + sticky summary bar as the Quote Form. Invoice list follows the Customers page pattern (stats bar + smart view tabs + data table). Component reuse is extensive: StatusBadge, ColumnHeaderMenu, CustomerCombobox, LineItemRow, PricingSummary, EmailPreviewModal.

**Compliance:** Screen printing is taxable as fabrication in virtually all states. The entire charge (materials + labor + setup + design) is taxable. The only common exemption is resale certificates. Invoices must be immutable once issued (void, never delete). 7-year data retention. QuickBooks Online is the primary accounting integration target. PCI compliance handled by using tokenized processors (Stripe/Square).

## 2. Industry Best Practices

### The 8-Step Quote-to-Cash Pipeline

Every screen printing shop follows this fundamental workflow, with variations in deposit percentage and payment terms:

```
Estimate/Quote  →  Customer Approval  →  Deposit (50%)  →  Work Order
     |                                                        |
  Production  →  Quality Check  →  Invoice (balance)  →  Delivery + Payment
```

### Standard Invoice Line Item Categories

| Category | Description | Typical Pricing |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Garment Cost | Wholesale with 150-200% markup | $5 wholesale → $7.50-$10 |
| Print Cost | Per piece, per color, per location | $1.80-$5.00/piece |
| Screen Setup | Per screen (per color per location) | $10-$30/screen |
| Art/Design | Custom artwork or modifications | $25 (text) to $65/hr (custom) |
| Color Change | Switching ink mid-run | $10-$15/change |
| Rush Fee | Tiered by turnaround time | 10-50% surcharge |
| Shipping | Carrier charges + handling | Actual + $6/box handling |
| Film Output | Cost of film positives | $12-$15 per spot color |
| Pantone Match | Custom color mixing | $10-$15 per color |
| Sample/Pre-prod | Test prints before full run | $150+ minimum |

### Payment Terms by Customer Type

| Term | Who Gets It | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| 100% Upfront | New/unknown customers | Full payment before production |
| 50% Deposit + Balance | Standard for most jobs | Industry standard |
| COD | Walk-in customers | Payment at pickup |
| Net 15 | Established customers | Requires credit application |
| Net 30 | Large/corporate accounts | 1.5%/month late fee standard |
| Net 60 | Rare, large contracts only | High risk for small shops |

### Industry Spoilage Standards

Spoilage affects invoicing through credit memos and adjustments:

- **Standard:** 2% acceptable spoilage rate
- **100+ pieces:** Up to 3%
- **Under 100 pieces:** Up to 10% (higher due to setup proportion)
- **Best-in-class target:** Under 2%

### Top 10 Invoicing Pain Points (Ranked by Frequency)

1. **Chasing late payments** — 87% of invoices paid late; over 50% of B2B invoices in US are past due
2. **Cash flow gaps** — fronting materials with Net 30 terms devastating for small shops
3. **Quote-to-invoice disconnection** — manual re-entry introduces errors
4. **Accounting sync issues** — one-directional sync, credit memos don't export
5. **Deposit tracking** — which deposits collected, applied, what balance remains
6. **Tax complexity** — resale certificates, expirations, multi-state nexus
7. **Change order management** — mid-production changes hard to track on invoices
8. **Overrun/underrun reconciliation** — actual vs ordered quantities
9. **Multiple payment methods** — cash + check + Venmo + card = reconciliation nightmare
10. **Professional appearance** — generic templates undermine credibility

### PrintLife Deep Assessment

**PrintLife Strengths (Match or Exceed):**

- **Supplier integration** — S&S, SanMar, Alphabroder directly in project builder
- **Ink change-out guardrail** — unique production safeguard, no competitor has this
- **Triple payment processor** — only platform with Stripe + PayPal + Square
- **SMS via Twilio** — quotes and invoices via text
- **Customer portal** — self-ordering within shop-defined parameters

**PrintLife Weaknesses (Our Opportunity):**

- **Single-user only** — dealbreaker for growing shops; role-based permissions undelivered
- **No G2/Capterra presence** — invisible to buyers researching options
- **Only QuickBooks Online** — no Xero, Sage, QB Desktop
- **No progress invoicing** — can't invoice partial deliveries
- **Limited reporting** — basic compared to Printavo/shopVOX
- **Small dev team** — roadmap items slip; bug fixes take priority

### Integration with Existing Verticals

| Vertical | Integration Point | Data Flow |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Quotes | Quote → Invoice conversion | Line items, pricing, discounts snapshot & lock. Only accepted quotes can generate invoices. |
| Customers | Financial context | `paymentTerms` → due date calc, `taxExempt` → tax rate, `billingAddress` → invoice address, `pricingTier` → default discount |
| Artwork | Billable charges | Art creation ($40 flat), revisions ($65/hr), complex custom (quoted). Referenced via `artworkId` |
| Screen Room | Setup fee itemization | Screen burn ($15-35/screen), reclaim ($5-10), color change ($5/screen). Linked via `jobId` |
| Production | Invoice triggers | "design" → deposit invoice, "shipped" → final invoice. Auto-flag shipped jobs with unpaid invoices |

### Integration with Future Verticals

| Vertical | Invoice Data Consumed |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Jobs | Quoted vs actual vs billed comparison. Profitability per job. Margin analysis. |
| Reporting | AR aging (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+), payment velocity, customer lifetime value, revenue trends, discount impact |
| Shipping | Shipping line items, delivery confirmation triggers final invoice, tracking numbers attached to invoices |
| Inventory | Garment COGS flows to job costing. Size upcharges through to invoice. Spoilage absorbed in margin. |

### Schema Dependencies

**Existing schemas that feed invoicing:** `customer.ts` (payment terms, tax-exempt, billing address, pricing tier), `quote.ts` (line items, discounts, shipping, tax), `job.ts` (production state triggers), `artwork.ts` (billable art charges), `screen.ts` (setup fees). **One existing schema needs update:** `note.ts` needs "invoice" added to `noteEntityTypeEnum`.

## 5. UX Recommendations

### Information Architecture

Add "Invoices" to sidebar between Quotes and Customers, reflecting the natural workflow order:

```
Dashboard    /
Jobs         /jobs
Quotes       /quotes
Invoices     /invoices       <-- NEW
Customers    /customers
Screen Room  /screens
Garments     /garments
```

### Key Screens

**Screen 1: Invoices List** `/invoices`

**Pattern:** Mirrors Customers page — Stats Bar + Smart View Tabs + Data Table

**Stats bar (4 KPIs):** Total Outstanding, Overdue Count & Amount, Paid This Month, Avg Days to Pay

**Smart view tabs:** All | Draft | Outstanding | Overdue | Paid

**Table columns:** Invoice #, Customer, Status, Amount, Due Date, Balance Due, Date Created

**Batch operations:** Send Selected, Mark as Paid, Send Reminder

**Screen 2: Invoice Detail** `/invoices/[id]`

**Pattern:** Mirrors QuoteDetailView

**Layout:** Sticky header (invoice # + status + actions) → Customer info card → Source links (quote, job) → Line items table → Pricing summary → Payment ledger + "Record Payment" → Reminder timeline → Notes

**Actions by status:**
- Draft: Edit, Send, Delete
- Sent/Open: Record Payment, Send Reminder, Void, Duplicate
- Overdue: Record Payment, Send Reminder (escalated), Void
- Paid: View Receipt, Duplicate

**Screen 3: New Invoice** `/invoices/new`

**Pattern:** Mirrors QuoteForm with collapsible sections + sticky summary bar

**Primary flow:** "Create Invoice" from accepted quote auto-populates everything

**Sections:** Customer (auto-filled) → Line Items (from quote, editable) → Pricing (auto-calculated) → Payment Terms (from customer default) → Notes

**Actions:** Cancel | Save as Draft | Review & Send

### Status Badges

| Status | Style | Token |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Draft | `bg-muted text-muted-foreground` | Neutral, low emphasis |
| Sent / Open | `bg-action/10 text-action` | Niji blue — awaiting action |
| Partially Paid | `bg-warning/10 text-warning` | Gold — in progress |
| Paid | `bg-success/10 text-success` | Green — complete |
| Overdue | `bg-error/10 text-error` | Red — needs attention |
| Void | `bg-muted text-muted-foreground` | Struck through, dimmed |

### Component Reuse Strategy

Extensive reuse from existing components minimizes build effort:

| Existing Component | Reuse For |
|--------------------|-----------|
| `StatusBadge` | Extend to support InvoiceStatus |
| `ColumnHeaderMenu` | Invoice table column sorting/filtering |
| `CustomerCombobox` | Customer selection on invoice form |
| `CollapsibleSection` | Invoice form sections |
| `LineItemRow` | Invoice line items (from quotes) |
| `PricingSummary` | Invoice pricing section |
| `EmailPreviewModal` | Invoice email preview |

### New Components Needed

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `InvoiceStatsBar` | 4 KPI cards for invoice list page |
| `PaymentLedger` | Table of recorded payments on invoice detail |
| `RecordPaymentSheet` | Slide-out form for recording payments |
| `InvoiceActions` | Context-aware action buttons per status |
| `PaymentReminderTimeline` | Visual timeline of sent/scheduled reminders |
| `OverdueBadge` | Badge with days overdue + pulse animation |

## 6. Legal & Compliance

### Tax Treatment: Screen Printing Is Fabrication

**Critical:** In virtually all major US states, screen printing is classified as **fabrication of tangible personal property**. The *entire* charge (materials + labor + setup + design) is taxable. Separately stating labor does NOT make it exempt. The only common exemption is a valid resale certificate.

| State | Tax Rate (State) | Treatment |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| California | 7.25% + local | Fabrication. Setup/rush fees included in taxable amount. |
| Texas | 6.25% + local (8.25% max) | Fabrication. Total sales price including all expenses. |
| Florida | 6% + local | Fully taxable. All charges even when separately stated. |
| New York | 4% + local (8.875% NYC) | Fabrication under Section 1105(c)(2). |
| Ohio | 5.75% + local | Services to tangible personal property are taxable. |
| North Carolina | 4.75% + local | Creative design charges included in taxable sales price. |

### Required Invoice Elements (US)

- Seller's legal business name and DBA
- Seller's business address
- Buyer's name and address
- Unique sequential invoice number
- Invoice date and due date
- Itemized description with quantities and unit prices
- Sales tax separately stated
- Total amount due
- Tax ID (EIN/TIN) for 1099 reporting thresholds
- Payment terms and accepted methods

### Data Integrity Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Invoice immutability | Never modify issued invoices. Use credit memos + new invoices for corrections. |
| Sequential numbering | Auto-increment, never skip or reuse voided numbers |
| Audit trail | Log every action: who, what, when, before/after values. Append-only. |
| Data retention | 7 years minimum (covers bad debt deductions, underreporting) |
| Never hard-delete | Void invoices, never delete. Keep all financial records. |
| PCI compliance | Never store card numbers. Use tokenized processors (Stripe/Square). |

### Accounting Integration: QuickBooks Online

| Entity | Direction | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Customers | Bidirectional | Name, email, address, tax-exempt |
| Invoices | App → QBO | Line items, tax, totals, due dates |
| Payments | App → QBO | Method, amount, applied to invoice |
| Tax Rates | QBO → App | Pull configured rates |
| Credit Memos | App → QBO | For refunds and adjustments |

**Top integration pitfalls:** Duplicate entries (biggest risk), 2-hour sync delays (Printavo), tax rounding differences, orphan records from deleted-not-voided invoices, OAuth token expiration. Use idempotency keys and always void (never delete).

## 7. Proposed Data Model

### Invoice Status State Machine

```
 draft --> sent --> viewed --> paid
                --> partial --> paid
 draft --> cancelled
 (any except paid) --> void
 (overdue is computed, not stored — past dueDate + unpaid)
```

### Core Enums

| Enum | Values |
|------|--------|
| `invoiceStatusEnum` | draft, sent, viewed, partial, paid, void, cancelled |
| `billingTypeEnum` | full, deposit, progress, final |
| `paymentMethodEnum` | cash, check, credit-card, debit-card, ach, venmo, zelle, paypal, other |
| `invoiceLineItemTypeEnum` | garment, decoration, setup, artwork, shipping, rush, discount, tax, adjustment, other |
| `creditMemoReasonEnum` | overpayment, return, defect, pricing-error, void-partial-paid, goodwill, other |

### Invoice Schema (Key Fields)

```
invoiceSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  invoiceNumber: z.string(),        // INV-1001
  customerId: z.string().uuid(),
  quoteId: z.string().uuid().optional(),
  jobId: z.string().uuid().optional(),
  billingType: billingTypeEnum,

  // Addresses (snapshot at creation)
  billingAddress: addressSchema.optional(),
  shippingAddress: addressSchema.optional(),

  // Line items
  lineItems: z.array(invoiceLineItemSchema),

  // Financial summary
  subtotal, discounts, taxRate, taxAmount,
  shipping, total, amountPaid, amountDue,
  payments: z.array(paymentSchema),

  // Dates
  invoiceDate, dueDate, paidDate?,

  // Price locking
  pricingSnapshot: { quoteTotal, lockedAt },

  // Status + lifecycle
  status: invoiceStatusEnum,
  sentAt?, viewedAt?, voidedAt?, voidReason?,

  // Notes
  internalNotes?, customerNotes?,
  termsAndConditions?,
})
```

### New Files Needed

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lib/schemas/invoice.ts` | Invoice schema + line item, payment, discount sub-schemas + all enums |
| `lib/schemas/credit-memo.ts` | Credit memo schema for adjustments and voids |
| Update `lib/constants.ts` | Add status labels, colors, billing type labels, payment method labels |
| Update `lib/schemas/note.ts` | Add "invoice" to `noteEntityTypeEnum` |

## 8. Build Sequence

### Phase 1a: Schema & Data Layer

1. Define `invoice.ts` schema (Zod)
2. Define `credit-memo.ts` schema
3. Update `note.ts` to include "invoice" entity type
4. Add invoice constants to `constants.ts`
5. Create mock invoice data in `mock-data.ts`
6. Write schema tests (Vitest)
7. Add reverse lookup helpers

### Phase 1b: Invoice List & Detail (Read-Only Views)

8. Invoice List page (`/invoices`) with DataTable, stats bar, smart view tabs
9. Invoice Detail page (`/invoices/[id]`) with header, line items, pricing summary, payment history
10. Add sidebar navigation link

### Phase 1c: Quote-to-Invoice Conversion

11. "Create Invoice" button on Quote Detail (accepted quotes only)
12. CreateInvoiceModal: billing type, deposit %, line item review, tax/shipping adjustment, preview
13. Invoice creation logic (client-side mock data mutation)

### Phase 1d: Payment Recording

14. RecordPaymentSheet: amount (pre-filled), method, reference, date, notes
15. Payment list on invoice detail
16. Auto-status update: partial → paid when fully paid

### Phase 1e: Customer Integration

17. Add "Invoices" tab to Customer Detail page
18. Customer financial summary: total billed, total paid, outstanding balance
19. Payment history on customer page

### Phase 2: Automation & Polish

20. Dashboard integration (overdue invoices, AR summary)
21. Invoice email preview
22. Void/cancel workflow with credit memo generation
23. Progress billing workflow (deposit → progress → final)
24. Invoice duplication
25. PDF preview/download

### Phase 3: Backend & Integrations

26. Database persistence
27. Email delivery
28. QuickBooks Online integration (OAuth 2.0)
29. Payment gateway (Square)
30. Automated recurring invoices

## 9. Differentiation Strategy

Gaps no competitor fills well, or features we can execute better:

### 1. Real-Time QuickBooks Sync

Printavo syncs every 2 hours. shopVOX requires manual config. Real-time, bidirectional sync is a headline differentiator that eliminates the #4 industry pain point.

### 2. Invoice Read Receipts + Smart Follow-Up

Only shopVOX Pro has read receipts ($199+/user). We build it as core: know when customers open invoices, auto-trigger follow-up if they view but don't pay within X days. Multi-channel (SMS + email).

### 3. Production-Aware Line Items

No competitor auto-populates invoice line items from the production workflow. If a job has 3 print locations with 4 colors each, plus garment data, the invoice auto-generates with all items pre-filled. Zero re-entry from quote to invoice.

### 4. First-Class Deposit Workflow

Configurable deposit % per customer or job type, automatic balance calculation, deposit receipt to customer, remaining balance prominently displayed on final invoice. Most competitors treat deposits as an afterthought.

### 5. Batch Operations for High-Volume Shops

Generate invoices for all completed jobs this week, batch send, batch mark as paid. For shops processing 50+ jobs/week, this is transformative. Only Printavo has multi-invoice payment (no one has batch operations).

### 6. Progressive Disclosure

shopVOX and DecoNetwork criticized for overwhelming complexity. We nail progressive disclosure: simple invoice creation under 5 minutes on day one, with advanced features (progress invoicing, PO numbers, custom fields) revealed as the shop grows.

### 7. Job Profitability Dashboard

Only Printavo offers basic P&L per order. We show real-time margin: garment cost + ink cost + screen cost + labor vs. invoice total. Immediate visibility into which jobs make money.

## 10. Key Decisions (Interview)

Critical decisions made during user interview with 4Ink owner. These override research recommendations where they differ.

| # | Decision | Answer | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Current invoicing state | QuickBooks (manual entry) | Eliminating double-entry is the core value prop |
| 2 | Line item display | Configurable per invoice | Toggle between itemized and bundled views |
| 3 | Deposit policy | Varies by customer | Smart defaults from tier + history |
| 4 | Accounting software | QuickBooks (Online or Desktop TBD) | Need to confirm with Chris |
| 5 | Quote-to-invoice conversion | Manual one-click | Allows production changes before invoicing |
| 6 | Payment processor | **Square** (4Ink's existing) | Don't fix what isn't broken |
| 7 | Customer-facing view | Separate vertical (customer portal) | All external views handled in portal vertical |
| 8 | Progress billing | Deposit + final only | Single invoice, deposits as partial payments |
| 9 | Deposit UX | Smart default with manual override | % or flat amount, driven by customer context |
| 10 | Invoice numbering | Match QuickBooks scheme | Ensures clean sync when integrated |
| 11 | Read receipts | Phase 2 (with customer portal) | Build status infrastructure now |
| 12 | Change tracking | Lightweight diff log | Track quote-to-invoice divergence internally |
| 13 | Payment reminders | Gentle cadence | 3 days before, on due, 3/7 days overdue |
| 14 | Late fees | Yes, configurable per customer | Auto-calculate, separate line item |
| 15 | Credit memos | Formal CM documents | Linked to original invoice, needed for QB sync |
| 16 | Phase 1 scope | Full internal flow | Schema + list + detail + create + payments + customer tab |
| 17 | Customer-furnished garments | Supported | Print/setup only, no garment charge |
| 18 | Multi-state tax | Mostly IN, some KY | Tax rate per invoice (not hardcoded) |
| 19 | AR aging | Stats bar on list page | Detailed report deferred to reporting vertical |

### Key Design Decision: Single Invoice with Partial Payments

Research initially recommended two separate invoices (deposit + final) as the "textbook" approach. 4Ink owner pushed back — wanted linked tracking, not independent documents. **Final decision:** Single invoice for the full amount. Deposits recorded as partial payments. Balance due updates automatically.

```
 Step                    Status          Balance Due
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Invoice created         Draft           $1,000
 Invoice sent            Sent            $1,000
 Deposit received ($500) Partial         $500
 Production happens      Partial         $500
 Final payment ($500)    Paid            $0
```

### Key Design Decision: Smart Deposit Defaults

Default deposit amount driven by: **customer tier** (standard/preferred/contract/wholesale sets baseline %), **payment history** (revenue, on-time record adjusts recommendation), **contract terms** (fixed negotiated amounts for contract customers). UX: pre-filled "Recommended Deposit" with manual override supporting both percentage and flat dollar amount.

### Key Correction: Square Over Stripe

Research recommended Stripe. **4Ink already uses Square.** Default to Square for payment processing integration (Phase 2+). Only consider Stripe if there's a compelling reason to switch.

### Open Items for Future Resolution

1. Confirm QuickBooks version — Online vs Desktop affects API approach (REST vs QBXML)
2. Invoice template branding — Does 4Ink want custom logo/colors on invoices?
3. Recurring invoices — Needed for contract customers with monthly orders? (Defer to Phase 2)
4. Multi-currency — International customers? (Likely not relevant for IN/KY market)
5. Commission tracking — Does 4Ink pay sales commissions? (Defer to reporting vertical)

## Table-Stakes Checklist

Every feature listed below is required to be competitive. Missing any one creates a dealbreaker for some segment of users:

1. One-click quote-to-invoice conversion with all data carrying over
