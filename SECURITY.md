# Security Policy

## Project Context

Screen Print Pro is production management software for a single print shop. This is a public repository for code access purposes — it is not an open-source project accepting external contributions.

## Supported Versions

Only the current `main` branch is maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email the repository owner directly rather than opening a public issue. Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

This is a single-operator project. Response time is best-effort.
