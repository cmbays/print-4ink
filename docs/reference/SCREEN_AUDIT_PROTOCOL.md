# Screen Audit Protocol

---

## Overview

This protocol defines the systematic audit process for evaluating Screen Print Pro page implementations. Every screen must pass this audit before being considered done (per CLAUDE.md Quality Checklist).

**Philosophy**: "Linear calm + Raycast polish + Neobrutalist delight"

---

## Pre-Audit Requirements

Before running the audit, ensure:

- [ ] FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md has been reviewed
- [ ] APP_FLOW.md entry exists for this screen (route, purpose, connections)
- [ ] Page loads without console errors
- [ ] All interactive features are functional

## The 15-Point Audit

### Visual Quality (1-5)

#### 1. Visual Hierarchy

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Does the eye land where it should? | Primary action is most prominent |
| Is the most important element obvious? | No competing elements at same visual weight |
| Can a user understand the screen in 5 seconds? | Purpose is immediately clear |

**Check**: Heading sizes use `text-2xl` > `text-xl` > `text-lg` hierarchy.

#### 2. Spacing & Rhythm

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Is whitespace consistent and intentional? | All spacing uses Tailwind utilities |
| Do elements breathe or are they cramped? | Minimum `gap-4` between sections |
| Is vertical rhythm harmonious? | Consistent gaps throughout |

**Check**: No hardcoded pixel values for margins/padding.

#### 3. Typography

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Are type sizes establishing clear hierarchy? | Max 3-4 distinct sizes per screen |
| Are there too many font weights competing? | Max 3 weights (normal, medium, semibold) |
| Does the type feel calm or chaotic? | Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code only |

**Check**: All text uses Tailwind `text-*` and `font-*` utilities.

#### 4. Color

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Is color used with restraint and purpose? | Base layer is monochrome |
| Do colors guide attention or scatter it? | Status colors only for communication |
| Is contrast sufficient for accessibility? | WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for text) |

**Check**: Colors use design tokens — no hex/rgb literals in components.

#### 5. Alignment & Grid

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Do elements sit on a consistent grid? | Visual alignment at all edges |
| Is anything off by 1-2 pixels? | Pixel-perfect alignment |
| Does every element feel locked into the layout? | No floating or misaligned items |

---

### Component Consistency (6-8)

#### 6. Components

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Are similar elements styled identically? | Same component = same styles everywhere |
| Are interactive elements obviously interactive? | Cursor changes, hover states present |
| Are all states accounted for? | Disabled, hover, active, focus-visible all styled |

**Check**: Uses shadcn/ui components from `components/ui/` where possible.

#### 7. Iconography

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Are icons consistent in style and weight? | All from Lucide React |
| Are they consistent in size? | Icons use standard sizes (`h-4 w-4`, `h-5 w-5`, `h-6 w-6`) |
| Do they support meaning or just decorate? | Every icon has purpose |

**Standard**: Lucide React only. No emoji. No custom SVGs.

#### 8. Motion & Transitions

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Do transitions feel natural and purposeful? | Tailwind `transition-*` for hover, Framer Motion for layout |
| Is there motion that exists for no reason? | Remove decorative animations |
| Does the page feel responsive to interaction? | Immediate feedback on click/hover |

**Check**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

---

### State Handling (9-11)

#### 9. Empty States

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| What does this screen look like with no data? | Intentional empty state designed |
| Do blank screens feel intentional or broken? | Clear messaging with Lucide icon |
| Is the user guided toward their first action? | CTA present in empty state where appropriate |

**Screen Print Pro examples**:
- Jobs List with no jobs: "No jobs yet. Jobs will appear here."
- Dashboard with no blocked items: "All clear — no blocked jobs"
- Customer Detail with no quotes: "No quotes for this customer"

#### 10. Loading States

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Are loading indicators consistent? | Same skeleton/spinner pattern everywhere |
| Does the page feel alive while waiting? | Visual feedback during operations |
| Are long operations handled? | Progress indication for >2s operations |

**Note**: Phase 1 uses mock data (synchronous), so loading states are minimal. Design skeleton patterns for Phase 2.

#### 11. Error States

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Are error messages styled consistently? | Use `text-error` / `border-error` tokens |
| Do they feel helpful and clear? | Plain language, actionable guidance |
| Are error messages accessible? | `role="alert"` or `aria-live` |

**Screen Print Pro examples**:
- Invalid job ID: "Job not found" + link back to `/jobs`
- No search results: "No results for '[query]'" + clear search action

---

### Responsive & Accessible (12-15)

#### 12. Dark Mode

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Do all semantic colors hold up? | Using `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, etc. |
| Are there hardcoded colors bypassing the theme? | No hex values in component code |
| Are shadows appropriate? | Subtle or removed |

**Note**: Dark mode is default. Verify all elements use Tailwind semantic classes.

#### 13. Density

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Can anything be removed without losing meaning? | Apply Jobs Filter |
| Are there redundant elements? | No duplicate information |
| Is every element earning its place? | Justify each element's existence |

#### 14. Responsiveness

| Question | Pass Criteria |
|----------|---------------|
| Does the layout handle different window sizes? | Test 1280px, 1440px, 1920px |
| Does content remain readable at all widths? | No horizontal overflow |
| Are controls accessible at all sizes? | Touch targets adequate |

**Note**: Desktop-first. Mobile is Phase 2 scope.

#### 15. Accessibility

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Keyboard navigation | All interactive elements focusable via Tab |
| Focus states | Visible `:focus-visible` indicators |
| ARIA labels | Icon-only buttons have `aria-label`, dynamic content has roles |
| Color contrast | 4.5:1 minimum for text |
| Screen reader flow | Logical reading order, headings in correct hierarchy |

---

## The Jobs Filter

For **every element** on the screen, ask these five questions:

### 1. "Would a user need to be told this exists?"

- **If yes**: Redesign it until it's obvious
- The best UI is invisible. Controls should be self-evident.

### 2. "Can this be removed without losing meaning?"

- **If yes**: Remove it
- Less is more. Every element adds cognitive load.

### 3. "Does this feel inevitable, like no other design was possible?"

- **If no**: It's not done
- Great design feels like the only possible solution.

### 4. "Is this detail as refined as the details users will never see?"

- The back of the fence must be painted too
- Consistency in the small details elevates the whole.

### 5. "Say no to 1,000 things"

- Cut good ideas to keep great ones
- Features compete for attention. Less but better.
