# Mobile Optimization — Scope Definition

**Purpose**: Define what "mobile optimization" means for Screen Print Pro, prioritize features, and establish acceptance criteria.
**Context**: No competitor in the screen print management space has a good mobile experience. This is our opportunity to differentiate.

---

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Mobile Viewport** | < 768px width (Tailwind `md:` breakpoint). Primary targets: 375px (iPhone SE), 390px (iPhone 14), 428px (iPhone 14 Pro Max) |
| **Touch Target** | Interactive element minimum size: 44x44px (WCAG) / 48x48dp (Material Design) |
| **Mobile Navigation** | Bottom tab bar + drawer for secondary nav. Replaces sidebar on mobile. |
| **Card Layout** | Stacked card view replacing tables on mobile. Shows key info, tap to expand. |
| **PWA** | Progressive Web App. Phase 2 enhancement adding offline, notifications, install. |
