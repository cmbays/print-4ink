## Terminology: Internal vs External Quoting

| Term                | Definition                                                                                                                | Phase                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Internal Quote**  | Shop operator builds quote for customer using `/quotes/new`. Shop controls pricing and sends final quote.                 | **Phase 1** (building now)                         |
| **External Quote**  | Customer submits quote request via customer portal. Shop reviews, adjusts, approves.                                      | **Phase 2** (UI mockups only in Phase 1)           |
| **Hybrid Approval** | Customer self-service + shop approval gate. Customer submits → shop reviews/adjusts price → approves → customer notified. | **Phase 2** (shop-side status tracking in Phase 1) |

**Phase 1 builds**: Internal quoting (shop-side form, quote list, quote detail, email preview mockup). All "Send to Customer" flows show UI mockups but don't actually send.

**Phase 2 builds**: Customer portal, customer self-service form, hybrid approval workflow, real email/notification sending.

---

## Design Principles (From Discovery)

1. **Never block input** — all calculations happen instantly client-side, never prevent typing
2. **Eliminate friction steps** — only show steps the shop actually uses, skip the rest
3. **Non-destructive editing** — changing one option never wipes other selections
4. **Keyboard-first data entry** — tab through all fields without mouse
5. **Persistent state** — auto-save drafts, URL-based state, never lose work
6. **Hybrid approval** — customer submits → shop reviews/adjusts → approves → customer notified
7. **Reuse over rebuild** — duplicate quotes, customer history, templates

---

## Journey Overview

### Internal Quote (Shop builds for customer)

**Target**:

- Simple quote: **3-4 minutes**, **8-12 clicks** (vs Print Life 10 min, 20-30 clicks)
- Complex quote: **6-8 minutes**, **20-30 clicks** (vs Print Life 15-20 min, 40-60 clicks)

### External Quote (Customer self-service with approval gate) — PHASE 2

**Target** (aspirational, not building in Phase 1):

- Customer submits request: **5-7 minutes** (streamlined form, no mandatory unused steps)
- Shop reviews + approves: **1-2 minutes** (price override + approve button)
- Customer receives final quote via email/portal link

## Key Differences from Print Life

| Aspect              | Print Life (6 Steps)                          | Screen Print Pro (1 Page)                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Flow**            | 6 mandatory sequential steps                  | Single scrollable form with sections      |
| **Steps**           | Can't skip unused steps                       | Only show what's needed                   |
| **Qty entry**       | Blocks on recalculation                       | Instant client-side calculation           |
| **Color picker**    | 103 tiny swatches, no search                  | S&S-style dense grid + search + favorites |
| **Art upload**      | Forced color swatches, resets on style change | Optional drag-drop, non-destructive       |

## Detailed Section Design

### Section 1: Customer Selection

**UI Elements**:

- Combobox with type-ahead search
- Dropdown shows: Customer Name — Company Name
- "Add New Customer" link at bottom of dropdown → opens simple modal (Name, Email, Company)
- After selecting customer, show compact info card: Name, Company, Email, "View History" link
- If customer has past quotes, show count badge: "3 previous quotes"

**Keyboard**: Tab to focus, type to search, Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select

**Friction Points Addressed**: None directly (Print Life has customer selection too), but ours is faster with type-ahead

---

### Section 2: Line Items

This is the heart of the form and where most time savings come from.

#### Garment Selection

**UI Elements**:

- Searchable dropdown/combobox
- Shows: Brand + SKU + Style Name (e.g., "Bella+Canvas 3001 — Unisex Short Sleeve")
- Type to filter (searches brand, SKU, style name)
- Recently used garments at top of list

**Keyboard**: Tab to focus, type to search, Arrow keys, Enter to select

**Friction Points Addressed**: #4 (overwhelming catalog) — search replaces scrolling through grid

#### Color Selection (S&S-Style Dense Swatch Grid)

**UI Elements** (per 4Ink owner request):

- Dense grid of color swatches packed tightly together (minimal gap between swatches)
- Each swatch is a square (~32-40px) with the actual color as background
- Color name displayed in **white text overlaid** on the swatch (small font, ~10-11px)
- For very light colors (white, cream): dark text overlay instead
- Search/filter bar above the grid: type "Black" to filter to matching colors
- Selected color has a visible checkmark overlay and/or border highlight
- "Favorites" row at top: starred colors appear first (persisted per user)
- Swatch grid scrollable if many colors, but visible area shows ~40-60 colors at once

**Example Layout**:

```
[Search colors...]

★ Favorites: [Black] [White] [Navy] [Red]

┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
│Black │White │Navy  │Red   │Royal │Kelly │Gold  │Orange│
│      │      │      │      │      │Green │      │      │
├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│Charc.│Hthr  │Maize │Maroon│Purple│Hthr  │Sand  │Berry │
│      │Grey  │      │      │      │Navy  │      │      │
├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│...   │...   │...   │...   │...   │...   │...   │...   │
└──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘
```

**Keyboard**: Tab to grid, Arrow keys to navigate swatches, Enter/Space to select

**Friction Points Addressed**: #4 (103 tiny swatches, no search) — dense but searchable grid with favorites

#### Quantity / Size Breakdown

**UI Elements**:

- Inline size grid: `XS | S | M | L | XL | 2XL | 3XL | 4XL | 5XL`
- Number input per size
- Total qty auto-calculated and displayed at end of row
- **All calculations are instant and client-side** — never block input
- Tab between size fields seamlessly
- Unit price and line total update in real-time as quantities change
- Optional: Show stock levels per size (from vendor API in Phase 2)

**Keyboard**: Tab through S → M → L → XL → 2XL etc. without any delay

**Friction Points Addressed**: #1 (CRITICAL — recalculation blocks input) — 100% eliminated

#### Print Locations

**UI Elements**:

- Checkbox group: ☐ Front ☐ Back ☐ Left Sleeve ☐ Right Sleeve ☐ Neck Label
- Click to toggle, no sub-steps or forced selections
- Optional: Color count per location (number input, defaults to 1)
- No forced art color swatch selection (addresses friction #5)
- No ink style or finishing sub-steps (addresses friction #2)

**Keyboard**: Tab to checkboxes, Space to toggle

**Friction Points Addressed**: #2 (mandatory unused steps), #3 (art style reset), #5 (forced art swatches)

#### Artwork (Optional, Collapsed)

**UI Elements**:

- Collapsed by default: "Artwork (Optional)" accordion
- Expand to show drag-and-drop zone per selected print location
- Accept .jpg, .png, .pdf, .ai, .eps
- Thumbnail preview after upload
- **Non-destructive**: Changing print locations or garment never clears uploaded artwork
- Phase 1: Show UI, don't process files

**Friction Points Addressed**: #3 (changing style resets art) — non-destructive editing

#### Line Item Pricing (Inline)

**UI Elements**:

- Right-aligned on the line item row:
  ```
  Unit: $8.50  ×  Qty: 50  =  Line Total: $425.00
  ```
- Auto-calculated from: garment base + (colors × upcharge) + (locations × upcharge)
- Updates instantly as any field changes
- Tooltip/info icon shows pricing breakdown

---

### Section 3: Pricing Summary

**UI Elements**:

```
Subtotal:    $425.00   (sum of all line items, read-only)
Setup Fees:  $50.00    (editable number field)
─────────────────────
Grand Total: $475.00   (auto-calculated, BUT editable for override)
```

- Grand Total is editable — shop can override the calculated price
- If overridden, show subtle indicator: "Price adjusted from $475.00"
- Override is the price the customer sees

**Friction Points Addressed**: Price override capability (requested in interview)

---

### Section 4: Notes (Optional, Collapsed)

**UI Elements**:

- Two text areas in a collapsed accordion:
  - "Internal Notes" — visible only to shop (e.g., "Rush order, customer is VIP")
  - "Customer Notes" — visible on sent quote (e.g., "Delivery in 2 weeks")

---

### Actions

**UI Elements**:

- **"Save as Draft"** — secondary button, saves quote with Draft status
- **"Save & Send to Customer"** — primary CTA (action blue, neobrutalist shadow), saves + opens send confirmation
- **"Cancel"** — text link, confirms before discarding

**Send Flow**:

1. Click "Save & Send" → modal with email preview
2. Shows: recipient email, subject, quote summary, portal link
3. Shop can edit before sending
4. "Send Quote" → status changes to Sent → email/notification sent to customer
5. Toast: "Quote Q-1024 sent to customer@email.com"

---

## Post-Flow: Quotes List Dashboard

### Quotes List (`/quotes`)

**Columns**: Quote # | Customer | Status | Items | Total | Date | Actions

**Status Badges**:

- Draft (gray) — editable, not sent
- Sent (blue) — sent to customer, awaiting response
- Accepted (green) — customer accepted
- Declined (red) — customer declined or expired
- Revised (amber) — customer requested changes

**Quick Actions** (per row):

- Edit (Draft only)
- Duplicate → creates new draft with same line items
- Send (Draft → Sent)
- View (opens detail)

**Filters**: Status dropdown, search by customer/quote #, date range

**Friction Points Addressed**: #6 (no quote reuse), #7 (no quote tracking)

---

## Post-Flow: Quote Detail (`/quotes/[id]`)

**Header**: Quote # + Status badge + Date + Customer (clickable link)

**Body**: Read-only version of the quote form (line items, pricing, notes)

**Actions**:

- "Edit Quote" (if Draft)
- "Duplicate Quote" → `/quotes/new` pre-filled
- "Send to Customer" (if Draft) → send flow
- "Convert to Invoice" (if Accepted) → Phase 2
- "Download PDF" → Phase 2

**Friction Points Addressed**: #6 (duplicate for reuse), #7 (status tracking), #8 (customer self-service)

---

## Hybrid Approval Workflow

This is our key differentiator — no competitor does this well.

```
CUSTOMER FLOW:
  Customer receives email/link → views quote on portal
    ↓
  Option A: "Accept Quote" → status changes to Accepted → shop notified
  Option B: "Request Changes" → adds comment → status changes to Revised → shop notified
  Option C: No action → quote expires after configurable period

SHOP FLOW:
  Shop receives notification (in-app + email)
    ↓
  Reviews quote in dashboard → can adjust price before customer sees it
    ↓
  "Approve & Send" → customer gets final quote
    ↓
  Tracks all quotes: Draft → Sent → Accepted/Declined/Revised
```

**Phase 1 Scope**: Build the shop-side UI (quotes list with statuses, send flow mockup). Customer portal is Phase 2.
