# Customer Management Vertical — Scope Definition

**Purpose**: Define boundaries for Customer Management mockup in Screen Print Pro
**Status**: Complete (finalized after competitive research + user interview)
**Depends on**: Competitive analysis (complete), industry research (complete), user interview (complete), quoting vertical (built)

---

## Design Philosophy

> "Don't build a CRM. Build a customer **view** that connects to everything else."

The customer detail page is a **dashboard, not a form**. It answers five questions in 5 seconds:

1. **Who is this customer?** (Company, contact, tag, lifecycle stage)
2. **What's our relationship?** (Lifetime orders, revenue, how long, health status)
3. **What's active right now?** (Open quotes, in-progress jobs)
4. **What did we do for them before?** (Past orders, artwork library)
5. **What do I need to know?** (Notes, preferences, tax exempt, pricing terms)

### Key Principles (from Interview)

- **One layout that breathes**: Same page structure for all customers. Content density adapts to lifecycle stage. Contract customers may warrant a view variant — evaluate during breadboarding.
- **80%+ auto-populate**: When you pick a customer, most fields inherit from their defaults. The software "knows" them.
- **Speed over features**: Adding a customer < 30 seconds. Seeing their full picture < 5 seconds.
- **Zero admin overhead**: Lifecycle transitions are automatic. Churn detection is automatic. The shop owner manages customers, not the software.
- **Record of truth**: Every feature moves toward making Screen Print Pro the single source of truth for customer relationships.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition | Phase |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Company** | Top-level entity. Owns aggregate stats, loyalty tier, pricing defaults. | **Phase 1** |
| **Group** | Optional subdivision within a company (e.g., Marketing Dept, Events Team). Shares artwork context. | **Phase 1** (simple implementation) |
| **Contact** | Individual person. Has own order history, artwork preferences, communication records. | **Phase 1** |
| **Lifecycle Stage** | Structured enum: Prospect → New → Repeat → Contract. Auto-progresses based on configurable criteria. | **Phase 1** |
| **Customer Health** | Automatic pattern detection: Active → Potentially Churning → Churned. Based on ordering frequency. | **Phase 1** (mock data) |
| **Type Tags** | Flexible classification: Retail, Sports/School, Corporate, Storefront/Merch, Wholesale. Multiple per customer. Extensible. | **Phase 1** (starter set) |
| **Custom Tags** | Free-form tags with optional attributes (e.g., seasonality). Shop-defined. | **Phase 2** |
| **Cascading Defaults** | Settings inherit: Company → Group → Contact → Transaction. Each level can override parent. | **Phase 1** (schema design) |
| **Storefront Customer** | A customer for whom the shop manages a branded online store. Tracked as a type tag. Storefront feature is Phase 2. | **Phase 1** (tag only) |

## CORE Features (Must Build)

These workflows are critical to demonstrating a best-in-class customer management experience. Fully functional in the mockup.

### ✅ Customer List Page (`/customers`)

**Purpose**: Browse, search, filter, and discover customers with smart views

**Features**:
- [ ] DataTable display with columns: Company, Primary Contact, Type Tags, Lifecycle Stage, Health, Last Order, Lifetime Revenue
- [ ] **Global search**: Search by company name, any contact name, email, phone, or order details (URL query param)
- [ ] **Smart view tabs/chips** across the top:
  - **All Customers**: Default view, all active customers
  - **Prospects**: Lifecycle = Prospect (leads not yet converted)
  - **Top Customers**: Sorted by lifetime revenue (trailing 12 months or all-time, togglable)
  - **Needs Attention**: Health = Potentially Churning (pattern-break detected)
  - **Seasonal**: Customers with orders matching current/upcoming season (calendar-aware)
- [ ] **Filter sidebar or chips**: Filter by type tag (Retail, Sports/School, Corporate, Storefront, Wholesale), lifecycle stage, health status
- [ ] **Sort by columns**: Click header to sort by company, last order date, revenue, etc.
- [ ] Click row → navigate to `/customers/[id]`
- [ ] "Add Customer" button (primary CTA) → opens AddCustomerModal
- [ ] Empty state: "No customers yet — they'll appear here when you create your first quote"
- [ ] Quick stats bar at top: Total Customers, Active This Month, Total Revenue (YTD), Prospects
- [ ] Archived customers hidden by default, toggle to show

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Can search for customer by company name, contact name, email, or phone
- ✅ Smart views surface the right customers (prospects, top, needs attention, seasonal)
- ✅ Can filter by type tag and lifecycle stage
- ✅ Can sort by any column
- ✅ Clicking customer opens detail view
- ✅ "Add Customer" button is prominent
- ✅ Archived customers are hidden but accessible

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Visual hierarchy: Smart view tabs most prominent, "Add Customer" is primary CTA
- [ ] Spacing: Tailwind tokens only
- [ ] Typography: Max 3-4 sizes (header, column headers, body, small stats)
- [ ] Color: Lifecycle badges (Prospect cyan, New neutral, Repeat green, Contract amber), Health indicators (Active none, Churning amber pulse, Churned red)
- [ ] Interactive states: All rows have hover state, selected smart view is highlighted
- [ ] Keyboard: Tab to customer, Enter to open
- [ ] Accessibility: ARIA labels for lifecycle stages and health indicators

---

### ✅ Customer Detail Dashboard (`/customers/[id]`)

**Purpose**: Complete picture of a customer relationship — the heart of this vertical

**Layout**: One consistent framework that adapts content density based on data available.

**Header Section** (always visible):
- [ ] Company name (large, prominent)
- [ ] Primary contact name, email, phone (click to copy)
- [ ] Lifecycle stage badge (Prospect / New / Repeat / Contract)
- [ ] Health indicator (Active / Potentially Churning / Churned) — only shows if not Active
- [ ] Type tag badges (Retail, Sports/School, etc.)
- [ ] Quick stats row:
  - Lifetime Revenue ($X,XXX)
  - Total Orders (XX)
  - Average Order Value ($XXX)
  - Last Order (XX days ago)
  - Referred Customers (X) — if any
- [ ] Action buttons: "New Quote" (primary CTA, pre-fills customer), "Edit Customer", "Archive"
- [ ] Breadcrumb: Dashboard > Customers > River City Brewing Co.

**Tabbed Sections** (below header):
- [ ] **Activity** (default tab): Reverse-chronological timeline of all interactions — quotes created/sent/accepted, jobs started/completed, notes added, artwork uploaded. Timestamped.
- [ ] **Quotes**: All quotes for this customer. Columns: Quote #, Status, Total, Date. Click → `/quotes/[id]`. "Start Similar Quote" button on each row.
- [ ] **Jobs**: All jobs for this customer. Columns: Job #, Status, Due Date, Total. Click → `/jobs/[id]` (Phase 2 link).
- [ ] **Artwork**: Smart artwork gallery (see Artwork Gallery section below).
- [ ] **Contacts**: Company → Group → Contact hierarchy view (see Hierarchy section below).
- [ ] **Details**: Full profile — billing/shipping addresses, tax exempt status, payment terms, pricing tier, referral source, all editable.
- [ ] **Notes**: All notes (customer-level + linked from quotes/artwork). Pinned notes at top. Channel-tagged (phone/email/text/social/in-person).

**Adaptive Behavior**:
- **Prospect** (sparse data): Header shows contact info + "Create First Quote" CTA. Tabs exist but sections show inviting empty states ("Quotes will appear here when you create one"). Notes tab is pre-selected (prospects need heavy note-taking).
- **New/Repeat** (moderate data): Stats populate in header. Quotes/Jobs tabs fill with history. Artwork gallery shows designs used.
- **Contract/Heavy** (rich data): Full stats, deep artwork gallery with smart sorting, pattern visibility in activity timeline.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Header shows complete customer context in 5 seconds
- ✅ Can navigate between tabs without page reload
- ✅ Activity timeline shows all interactions chronologically
- ✅ Can create a new quote pre-filled with this customer
- ✅ "Start Similar Quote" works from quote history
- ✅ Artwork gallery shows customer's designs with smart sorting
- ✅ Contacts tab shows hierarchy (Company → Group → Contact)
- ✅ Details tab allows editing customer profile
- ✅ Invalid customer ID shows "Customer not found" with link to customer list
- ✅ Empty states are inviting, not broken-looking

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Visual hierarchy: Company name and quick stats most prominent
- [ ] Spacing: Balanced sections with clear tab separation
- [ ] Typography: Consistent with quoting views
- [ ] Color: Lifecycle/health badges meaningful, not decorative
- [ ] Interactive states: Tab hover/active states, action button states
- [ ] Empty states: Designed for each tab (not generic "no data")
- [ ] Accessibility: Tabs are keyboard navigable, ARIA labels on all badges

---

### ✅ Company → Group → Contact Hierarchy

**Purpose**: Support multi-contact companies with department-level organization

**Data Model**:
```
Company (River City Brewing Co.)
  ├── Group: Marketing Dept
  │     ├── Contact: Marcus Rivera (ordering, primary)
  │     └── Contact: Lisa Park (art approver)
  ├── Group: Events Team
  │     └── Contact: Dave Chen (ordering)
  └── Aggregate: All spend, all artwork, loyalty tier
```

**Features**:
- [ ] **Simple by default**: Most customers = 1 Company + 1 Contact. No groups required.
- [ ] **Expandable**: "Add Contact" button adds another person. "Add Group" appears when 2+ contacts exist (progressive disclosure).
- [ ] **Contact roles**: Each contact has a role: Ordering, Art Approver, Billing, Owner, Other
- [ ] **Primary contact**: One contact marked as primary (default for new quotes)
- [ ] **View at any level**:
  - Company view: aggregate spend, all contacts, all artwork
  - Group view: group-specific artwork, group contacts, group spend
  - Contact view: individual order history, personal artwork associations
- [ ] **Cascading defaults**: Payment terms, tax status, billing address set at Company level. Groups and Contacts inherit unless overridden.
- [ ] **Discoverability**: Subtle "Add Contact" hint on customer detail page. Tooltip explains groups when relevant.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Can add multiple contacts to a company
- ✅ Can assign roles to contacts
- ✅ Can designate primary contact
- ✅ Can create groups within a company
- ✅ Company-level stats aggregate all contacts' activity
- ✅ Simple case (1 contact, no groups) feels clean and unbloated

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Visual: Clean hierarchy display (indented or card-based)
- [ ] Progressive disclosure: Groups don't appear until needed
- [ ] Typography: Contact names prominent, roles as subtle badges
- [ ] Interactive: Click contact to see their individual activity

---

### ✅ Customer Lifecycle (Auto-Progression)

**Purpose**: Automatically track where each customer is in their relationship lifecycle

**Lifecycle Stages** (structured enum, auto-progressing):

| Stage | Trigger | Display |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Prospect** | Created from quoting or manually added without a completed order | Cyan badge |
| **New Customer** | First completed and paid order | Neutral/white badge |
| **Repeat** | 2+ completed orders OR orders spanning 2+ distinct months | Green badge |
| **Contract** | Manual promotion by shop owner (formal agreement) OR configurable spend threshold | Amber badge |

**Features**:
- [ ] Auto-transition: Prospect → New (on first completed order), New → Repeat (on 2nd order or 2+ months of orders)
- [ ] Manual override: Shop owner can promote any customer to Contract status at any time
- [ ] Configurable thresholds (Phase 2): Settings page where shop sets "Repeat after X orders" and "Contract after $Y spent"
- [ ] Phase 1 defaults: Hardcoded sensible thresholds (1st order = New, 2+ orders = Repeat, Contract = manual only)
- [ ] Lifecycle badge visible on customer list, detail page, and quote form customer selector
- [ ] Lifecycle change logged in activity timeline

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Prospect auto-promotes to New Customer when mock data shows a completed order
- ✅ New auto-promotes to Repeat when 2+ orders exist in mock data
- ✅ Contract can be manually set
- ✅ Badge reflects current stage everywhere it appears
- ✅ Mock data includes customers at each lifecycle stage

---

### ✅ Customer Health Detection

**Purpose**: Automatically flag customers whose ordering pattern has broken

**Health States**:

| State | Trigger | Display |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Active** | Ordering within expected pattern | No indicator (absence = healthy) |
| **Potentially Churning** | No order for 2x their average order interval | Amber "Needs attention" badge |
| **Churned** | No order for 4x their average order interval or 6+ months, whichever is shorter | Red "Inactive" badge |
| **Archived** | Manual action by shop owner | Hidden from default views, shown in "Archived" filter |

**Features**:
- [ ] Health status calculated from mock data order patterns
- [ ] "Needs Attention" smart view on customer list filters by Potentially Churning
- [ ] Health badge on customer detail header (only when not Active)
- [ ] Archive action on customer detail page (with confirmation dialog)
- [ ] Archived customers: hidden from default list, accessible via filter toggle
- [ ] Reactivate: archived customer can be unarchived

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Mock data includes at least 1 customer in each health state
- ✅ "Needs Attention" view shows only potentially churning customers
- ✅ Can archive and unarchive a customer
- ✅ Archived customers don't clutter the main view

---

### ✅ Customer Type Tags

**Purpose**: Classify customers by business type for filtering and segmentation

**Starter Set**:
- Retail (general retail customers)
- Sports/School (leagues, teams, schools)
- Corporate (company branded apparel)
- Storefront/Merch (influencers, content creators — has a storefront, Phase 2 feature)
- Wholesale (other print shops, decorators, brokers)

**Features**:
- [ ] Multiple tags per customer (a school can also be a storefront customer)
- [ ] Tags displayed as colored badges on customer list and detail page
- [ ] Filter customer list by type tag
- [ ] Tags selectable from starter set during customer creation/editing
- [ ] Phase 1: Starter set only. Phase 2: Custom tags with shop-defined names and optional attributes (e.g., seasonality).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Can assign multiple type tags to a customer
- ✅ Can filter customer list by type tag
- ✅ Tags display consistently across list and detail views
- ✅ Mock data uses variety of tags

---

### ✅ Quick Add Customer (Enhanced Modal)

**Purpose**: Create new customers quickly from anywhere — customer list, quote form, or future invoicing

**Fields**:
- [ ] Company Name (required)
- [ ] Contact Name (required)
- [ ] Email OR Phone (at least one required — don't force both)
- [ ] Type Tag (optional, multi-select from starter set)
- [ ] Lifecycle Stage: auto-set to "Prospect" when created from quoting, "New" when created from customer management
- [ ] All other fields (address, tax status, payment terms, notes) are optional — can be enriched later

**Features**:
- [ ] Reuses existing `AddCustomerModal` component (expanded)
- [ ] Creates a full customer record (single source of truth)
- [ ] Auto-selects the new customer in the quote form if triggered from there
- [ ] "Needs Details" visual indicator on customer list for records with minimal data
- [ ] < 30 seconds to complete

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Can create customer with just company + contact name + email
- ✅ New customer appears immediately in customer list and quote form
- ✅ Auto-tagged as Prospect when created from quoting
- ✅ Minimal fields are truly minimal — no forced data entry

---

### ✅ Customer Notes (Contextual Notes Web)

**Purpose**: Capture institutional knowledge that lives in the shop owner's head

**Note Types**:

| Type | Lives On | Surfaces In |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Customer note** | Customer record | Detail page Notes tab, pinned at top if flagged |
| **Quote note** | Quote record (already exists) | Quote detail, customer Activity timeline |
| **Artwork note** | Artwork record | Artwork gallery tooltip, quote form artwork selector |

**Features**:
- [ ] **Freeform + timestamped**: Each note has content, createdAt, createdBy
- [ ] **Pinnable**: Important notes can be pinned to top ("Always charge rush fee", "Picky about Pantone matching")
- [ ] **Channel-tagged** (optional): Phone, Email, Text, Social, In-Person — helps reconstruct communication history
- [ ] **Smart prompts**: If a note is tagged as "Phone" but customer has no phone number, prompt to add it
- [ ] **Quick add**: Single-line input at top of Notes tab for fast note entry
- [ ] **Surfacing**: Artwork notes appear as tooltips in the gallery. Quote notes appear in the customer activity timeline.
- [ ] **Prospect-focused**: Notes tab is the default tab for Prospects (heavy back-and-forth during lead conversion)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Can add, pin, and view notes on customer record
- ✅ Notes are timestamped and attributed
- ✅ Pinned notes stay at top
- ✅ Channel tags are optional but available
- ✅ Artwork notes surface in gallery tooltips
- ✅ Notes tab is default for Prospect lifecycle stage

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Visual: Clean note list, timestamps subtle, pinned notes visually distinct
- [ ] Interactive: Quick-add input always visible, pin toggle easy to tap
- [ ] Typography: Note content readable, metadata (date, channel) secondary
- [ ] Accessibility: Notes list is screen-reader friendly

---

### ✅ Smart Artwork Gallery

**Purpose**: Visual, volume-prioritized, season-aware artwork display per customer

**Features**:
- [ ] **Thumbnail grid**: Artwork displayed as visual thumbnails (not a text list)
- [ ] **Smart sort order**:
  1. Volume outliers first — artwork that drives disproportionate sales gets prime position
  2. Seasonal relevance — designs matching current/upcoming season surface higher
  3. Customer-specific seasonality — designs ordered annually around this time of year surface
  4. Recent usage — most recently ordered artwork next
  5. Alphabetical as fallback
- [ ] **Per-artwork metadata**: Color count, last used date, total orders, linked jobs
- [ ] **Artwork notes**: Notes attached to artwork show as tooltips on hover
- [ ] **Visual importance cues**: Subtle size variation or badges ("Top seller", "In season") — NOT treemap distortion
- [ ] **Full library browsable**: Smart sort is default, but can switch to alphabetical/chronological
- [ ] **Link to quotes**: Click artwork thumbnail to see which quotes/jobs used it
- [ ] **"Use in New Quote" action**: Select artwork directly from gallery to start a new quote

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Artwork displays as visual thumbnails
- ✅ Highest-volume artwork appears first
- ✅ Seasonal artwork surfaces when relevant (mock: based on mock dates)
- ✅ Artwork notes show on hover
- ✅ Can navigate from artwork to its linked quotes

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Visual: This is the aesthetic showpiece — beautiful grid, consistent thumbnails
- [ ] Spacing: Tight but breathable grid (similar to S&S color swatch density)
- [ ] Interactive: Hover shows metadata tooltip with notes, click opens detail
- [ ] Responsive: Grid adapts to screen width
- [ ] Empty state: "No artwork yet — artwork will appear here from quotes" (inviting, not broken)

---

### ✅ Referral Tracking (Basic)

**Purpose**: Track which customers refer new business — word of mouth is 4Ink's primary growth channel

**Features**:
- [ ] **"Referred by" field** on customer record — dropdown of existing customers or free text
- [ ] **Referral stats on referrer's profile**: "Marcus has referred 4 customers" with names listed
- [ ] **Referred revenue**: Total revenue from referred customers visible on referrer's detail page
- [ ] **Referral visible in customer list**: Referral count as a column or badge

**Phase 2 (not building now)**:
- Referral incentive programs (discount triggers based on referral volume)
- Referral chain visualization
- Lead source attribution reporting

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Can set "Referred by" on a customer record
- ✅ Referrer's profile shows referral count and referred revenue
- ✅ Mock data includes at least 2 referral relationships

---

## PERIPHERAL Features (Show in UI, Simplified or Non-Functional)

These features are valuable but won't block the demo. Show them in UI so the journey feels complete.

### 🟡 Tax Exempt Certificate Tracking

**Purpose**: Legal requirement for schools, nonprofits, and reseller accounts

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Tax exempt toggle (boolean) on customer Details tab
- [ ] Certificate status: Exempt / Not Exempt / Expired
- [ ] Expiration date field (with visual warning when approaching/past expiry)
- [ ] "Upload Certificate" area (mock — shows placeholder, doesn't store files)
- [ ] Tax status visible on customer list as a subtle icon/badge
- [ ] Tax status inherits to quotes (auto-applied when customer is selected)

---

### 🟡 Multiple Shipping Addresses

**Purpose**: Customers with multiple locations (HQ, warehouse, event venues)

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Billing address (single, on Details tab)
- [ ] Shipping addresses (multiple, named): "HQ", "Warehouse", "Event Venue"
- [ ] Default shipping address flag (used on new quotes)
- [ ] Add/edit/remove addresses
- [ ] Address inherits to quotes when customer is selected (default shipping address)
- [ ] **Phase 2 (backend)**: Google Maps-style address autocomplete — as user types, suggest matching addresses. Phase 1 is manual entry only.

---

### 🟡 Customer Statistics Panel

**Purpose**: At-a-glance metrics for customer value assessment

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Lifetime revenue (sum of all completed orders)
- [ ] Total orders (count)
- [ ] Average order value
- [ ] Last order date (with "X days ago" relative display)
- [ ] Quote-to-order conversion rate
- [ ] Referred customers count + referred revenue
- [ ] "Member since" date
- [ ] Stats displayed in customer detail header and available on customer list as columns

---

### 🟡 Reorder from Customer Detail (Leverages Existing "Copy as New")

**Purpose**: Reduce reorder friction — the #1 revenue killer identified in research

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Quote rows in customer detail Quotes tab include "Copy as New" action (already built in quoting vertical)
- [ ] This reuses the existing "Duplicate Quote" / "Copy as New" functionality from the quoting vertical
- [ ] No new functionality needed — just surface the existing action within the customer detail context
- [ ] **Already built**: "Copy as New" on quotes list and quote detail page

---

### 🟡 Payment Terms (Customer-Level Defaults)

**Purpose**: Different customers have different payment expectations

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Payment terms field on customer Details tab
- [ ] Options: COD (Cash on Delivery), Payment Upfront, Net 15, Net 30, Net 60
- [ ] Default for new customers: Payment Upfront (matches 4Ink's current direction)
- [ ] Contract customers: typically Net 30
- [ ] Inherits to invoices (Phase 2 invoicing vertical reads this field)
- [ ] Payment terms visible on customer detail header (subtle, not prominent)

---

### 🟡 Pricing Tier / Default Discount

**Purpose**: Replace hardcoded 7% contract discount with customer-level pricing

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Pricing tier selector: Standard, Preferred (5%), Contract (configurable %)
- [ ] Custom discount percentage field (overrides tier default)
- [ ] Discount auto-applied when customer is selected in quote form
- [ ] Replaces current hardcoded `customerTag === "contract" → 7%` logic
- [ ] Cascading: Company tier is default, Group/Contact can override

---

## INTERCONNECTIONS (Minimal Representation)

These features touch other verticals but won't be fully built yet. Show them in UI to complete the journey.

### → Quoting: Customer Selection (Enhanced)

**Current State**: CustomerCombobox selects from mock data, AddCustomerModal creates inline
**Enhancement**:
- [ ] Customer combobox shows lifecycle stage badge next to each name
- [ ] Selecting customer auto-loads: artwork library, pricing tier/discount, tax status, shipping address
- [ ] "View Customer" link on quote form opens customer detail in new tab
- [ ] Quote form customer section shows enriched info (contact role, company, tags)
- [ ] Customer created from quote form auto-tagged as Prospect
- [ ] **Don't build**: Customer editing from within quote form
- **Already built**: CustomerCombobox, AddCustomerModal, customer display in QuoteDetailView

### → Invoicing: Cascading Defaults (Schema Ready)

**Current State**: No invoicing exists yet
**Preparation**:
- [ ] Customer schema includes: paymentTerms, billingAddress, taxExempt, pricingTier, discountPercentage
- [ ] These fields are designed for invoice inheritance: invoice reads customer defaults, allows per-transaction override
- [ ] Cascading model: Company → Group → Contact → Transaction (each level can override parent)
- [ ] **Don't build**: Invoice creation, invoice list, payment tracking
- **Phase 2**: Invoicing vertical will inherit customer defaults seamlessly

### → Artwork Management: Customer Artwork Library

**Current State**: Artwork linked to customers via customerId FK, displayed in quote form
**Enhancement**:
- [ ] Artwork gallery on customer detail page (smart sorted)
- [ ] Artwork notes surface as tooltips in gallery and quote form
- [ ] "Use in New Quote" action from artwork gallery
- [ ] **Don't build**: Artwork upload/management CRUD (beyond mock display)
- **Phase 2**: Full artwork management may become its own feature

### → Reporting: Customer Value Metrics

**Current State**: No reporting exists
**Preparation**:
- [ ] Customer stats (revenue, orders, conversion rate) computed from mock data
- [ ] Customer list sortable by revenue (feeds "Top Customers" view)
- [ ] Health detection (churn patterns) computed from mock order dates
- [ ] **Don't build**: Reporting dashboards, trend charts, export
- **Phase 2**: Reporting vertical will aggregate customer metrics

### → Storefront: Customer Type Tag (Placeholder)

**Current State**: 4Ink uses separate software for storefronts
**Preparation**:
- [ ] "Storefront/Merch" type tag available for customers
- [ ] No storefront functionality built
- [ ] Customer schema flexible enough to add storefront-related fields later
- [ ] **Don't build**: Storefront creation, management, or customer-facing stores
- **Phase 2**: Storefront vertical will build on customer records tagged as Storefront

### → Customer Portal: Shared Data Model

**Current State**: Customer Portal will be a separate Phase 1 vertical (external-facing)
**Preparation**:
- [ ] Customer schema designed to support both internal (this vertical) and external (portal) access
- [ ] Contact records include email for portal login credentials (future)
- [ ] Quote/job data linkable to portal views
- [ ] **Don't build**: Any portal UI in this vertical
- **Separate vertical**: Customer Portal will have its own scope definition and discovery

---

## What We're Explicitly NOT Building

### ❌ Customer Portal / Self-Service (Separate Vertical)

**Why**: The Customer Portal is a distinct vertical — the external-facing view that a shop's customers experience. It will be built as a Phase 1 mock demo, but under its own scope definition and discovery process.
**Relationship**: Customer Management (this vertical) = internal shop-side tool. Customer Portal = external customer-facing tool. They share the same customer data model and will have significant overlap, but are scoped and built separately.
**What we do in this vertical**: Design the customer schema and data model to support portal access. The portal vertical will read from the same customer records.

### ❌ Communication Auto-Import

**Why**: Email forwarding, SMS integration, social DM aggregation requires backend infrastructure
**What we do instead**: Channel-tagged notes (manual but structured)
**Vision**: Phase 2+ — explore email import, Twilio integration, LLM-assisted communication aggregation

### ❌ Custom Tags with Attributes

**Why**: Shop-defined tags with properties (e.g., "this tag has seasonality") adds significant complexity
**What we do instead**: Starter set of type tags. Custom free-text tags (simple) in Phase 2.
**Vision**: Phase 3 — custom tag attributes that the system leverages for smart surfacing

### ❌ Referral Incentive Programs

**Why**: Discount triggers based on referral volume requires pricing engine integration
**What we do instead**: Basic "Referred by" tracking + referral stats display

### ❌ Credit Limit Management

**Why**: Requires invoicing integration and balance tracking
**What we do instead**: Payment terms field on customer record

### ❌ Sales Pipeline / Lead Management

**Why**: 4Ink knows all prospects by name. Pipeline stages are overkill for small shops.
**What we do instead**: Prospect lifecycle stage + "Needs Attention" view

### ❌ CSV Import/Export

**Why**: Phase 2 feature — important for migration but not critical for demo
**What we do instead**: Mock data seeded in code

### ❌ Configurable Lifecycle Thresholds

**Why**: Phase 2 settings page feature
**What we do instead**: Hardcoded sensible defaults (1st order = New, 2+ orders = Repeat, Contract = manual)

### ❌ Calendar/Seasonal Smart View (Full Implementation)

**Why**: Requires order date analysis and seasonality detection algorithms
**What we do instead**: Mock the "Seasonal" tab on customer list with pre-tagged mock data. Full seasonal intelligence is Phase 2.

## Schema Expansion

### Current Schema (7 fields)

```typescript
// lib/schemas/customer.ts (existing)
export const customerSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),

## Open Questions (For Gary / Future Interview)

These items were flagged during the interview as needing Gary's direct input:

1. **Contract pricing thresholds**: What spend level triggers contract pricing at 4Ink? Is it cumulative or per-order?
2. **Communication preferences**: How does Gary prefer to communicate with different customer types?
3. **Multiple contacts**: How often does Gary deal with multiple contacts at one company? Is the Group concept overkill?
4. **Payment terms specifics**: What payment terms does 4Ink currently offer? Has moving to upfront payment been successful?
5. **Storefront software**: What software does Gary use for storefronts? What does he dislike about it?
6. **Seasonal patterns**: Which customers have strong seasonal ordering patterns? Can we get specific examples?
