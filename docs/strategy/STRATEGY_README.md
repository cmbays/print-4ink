# Strategy Documentation Index

This folder contains all strategy-level documents for Screen Print Pro's vertical-by-vertical development approach.

---

## Master Strategy Document

### [vertical-by-vertical-strategy.md](/.claude/plans/vertical-by-vertical-strategy.md)

**Read this first.** Contains:
- Executive summary of the strategic pivot
- Core methodology (4-phase approach per vertical)
- Pilot vertical overview (Quoting)
- Subsequent verticals roadmap
- Success criteria and timeline
- Relationship to original 10-step plan

**When to read**: Before starting any vertical development

---

## Quoting Vertical Documents

These documents guide the Quoting vertical (pilot), which establishes the repeatable methodology.

### Phase 1: Discovery

#### [quoting-discovery-interview-questions.md](quoting-discovery-interview-questions.md)

**30-45 minute interview guide** with 25+ questions structure for talking to Chris (4Ink owner) about:
- Current Print Life workflow (8-10 min)
- Pain points and friction (8-10 min)
- Interconnections with other verticals (5 min)
- Wishlist and ideal workflow (5 min)
- Design validation (3-5 min)

**When to use**: Before/during user interview with Chris
**Owner**: AI + Chris (collaborative)

#### [print-life-quoting-analysis.md](../competitive-analysis/print-life-quoting-analysis.md)

**Print Life feature and workflow analysis** to be filled in by:
- Screenshot review
- Chris's Print Life trial walkthrough
- Comprehensive feature list
- Workflow steps (simple and complex quotes)
- UI pattern observations
- Friction point inventory
- Click and time analysis

**When to use**: While Chris is doing Print Life trial
**Status**: Template ready, waiting for trial data

#### [print-life-journey-quoting.md](../competitive-analysis/print-life-journey-quoting.md)

**Detailed journey map** documenting:
- Step-by-step Print Life quoting workflow
- Friction points with severity/frequency ratings
- Click-by-click walkthrough
- Time distribution across steps
- Interconnections with other verticals (Quote → Job, Quote → Invoice, Quote → Reporting)

**When to use**: After Print Life trial, before design work
**Status**: Template ready, waiting for trial data

### Phase 2: Scope Definition

#### [quoting-scope-definition.md](quoting-scope-definition.md)

**Scope boundaries** defining:
- **CORE features** (must build, fully functional):
  - Quotes List page
  - Quote Detail page
  - New Quote Form
- **PERIPHERAL features** (show in UI, simplified):
  - Customer creation modal
  - Artwork upload placeholder
  - Quote PDF preview
  - "Send to Customer" email preview
- **INTERCONNECTIONS** (minimal representation):
  - Customer selection (linked to Customer Management vertical)
  - Auto-calculated pricing (linked to Pricing Matrix vertical)
  - "Convert to Invoice" button (linked to Invoicing vertical)
  - Quote totals for reporting (linked to Reporting vertical)
  - Public quote view link (linked to Customer Portal in Phase 2)
- **NOT BUILDING** (explicitly deferred):
  - Customer portal page
  - Invoice generation
  - Pricing matrix admin UI
  - Real PDF generation
  - Email sending

**When to use**: Before frontend-builder agent builds screens
**Status**: Complete and ready

### Phase 3: Build Execution

#### [screen-print-pro-journey-quoting.md](screen-print-pro-journey-quoting.md) *(to be created)*

**Screen Print Pro's improved workflow design** documenting:
- Target click count vs Print Life
- Target time estimate vs Print Life
- Key improvements and rationale
- Design validation with user ("Does this wow you?")

**When to use**: Before design mockups, to set goals
**Status**: To be created after discovery phase

### Phase 4: Demo & Iteration

#### Demo Feedback Document *(to be created)*

**User feedback from Quoting demo** documenting:
- What resonated ("this is so much better")
- What confused ("I didn't understand this")
- Rating feedback (Clarity, Speed, Polish, Value)
- Requested changes
- Success/failure assessment

**When to use**: After user demo
**Status**: To be created after build completion

- `docs/competitive-analysis/print-life-journey-customer.md`
- `docs/strategy/customer-management-scope-definition.md`
- `docs/strategy/screen-print-pro-journey-customer.md`

### Pricing Matrix Vertical (TBD)
- Similar 4-document set

### Reporting Vertical (TBD, STRETCH)
