## Interview Script

### Opening (2 min)

"Thanks for taking time for this. I want to deeply understand how you currently create quotes in Print Life, where you're experiencing friction, and what an ideal quoting experience would look like. This will help us design a significantly better workflow for Screen Print Pro."

---

## Section 1: Current Workflow (8-10 min)

**Goal**: Document the exact steps Chris takes to create a quote, from start to finish.

### Q1.1: Walk-Through (Open-ended)
> "Can you walk me through how you create a typical quote in Print Life? Start from 'customer calls asking for pricing' and take me through every step until the quote is sent or saved."

**Listen for**: Click sequence, screen transitions, modals, time spent per step

**Follow-ups**:
- "How many clicks does that take from start to finish?"
- "How long does that typically take you? (Give me a rough time estimate)"
- "Is that the same workflow every time, or do you vary it?"

### Q1.2: Simple vs Complex Quotes
> "Walk me through creating a *simple* quote — say, one garment style, one color, 50 units."
>
> "Now tell me about a *complex* quote — multiple garment styles, multiple colors, different print locations on each, maybe size breakdowns."

**Listen for**:
- Do the steps change significantly between simple and complex?
- Where does complexity add the most friction?
- How many line items do complex quotes typically have?

### Q1.3: Garment Selection
> "How do you select the garment in Print Life? What's that workflow?"

**Listen for**:
- Visual catalog (swatches, images) or dropdown with SKU?
- Can you search/filter by style, brand, color?
- Do you see size availability, inventory, pricing during selection?
- How many clicks to find the right garment?

**Follow-up**:
- "Do you have a mental 'top 5' garments you use most often? Does Print Life make it easy to reuse them?"

### Q1.4: Quantity & Size Entry
> "How do you enter quantities in Print Life? Do you just put in a total number, or do you break it down by size?"

**Listen for**:
- Is there a size breakdown grid (S, M, L, XL)?
- Can you edit sizes inline or does it open a modal?
- How many clicks to complete a quantity entry?

### Q1.5: Print Locations & Colors
> "How do you specify where the design will be printed (front, back, sleeves, etc.) and how many colors each location has?"

**Listen for**:
- Dropdown, multi-select, buttons, modals?
- Do you specify colors per location?
- Any preset templates for common combinations?

### Q1.6: Pricing & Calculations
> "How does Print Life handle pricing? Do you manually enter unit prices, or does it auto-calculate?"

**Listen for**:
- Manual entry per line item?
- Auto-calculation based on quantity/colors/locations?
- Does pricing show in real-time as you fill out the form, or do you have to save first?
- Where do the pricing rules come from — a rate card, spreadsheet, hard-coded in Print Life?

### Q1.7: Artwork
> "How does Print Life handle artwork in the quoting process? Do you need to upload artwork to create a quote, or is that optional?"

**Listen for**:
- Can you create a quote without artwork?
- If artwork is needed, when does it happen (before quote or after customer accepts)?
- Do you need to attach artwork files in the quote itself?

### Q1.8: Quote Submission
> "After you finish the quote, what happens next? How do you get it to the customer?"

**Listen for**:
- Is there a "Send to Customer" button or is it manual (email, portal)?
- Does the customer receive a PDF, a link, both?
- Does the customer need to log in to Print Life to view it, or is it a public link?
- If they accept, does it automatically become a job?

---

## Section 2: Pain Points (8-10 min)

**Goal**: Identify specific friction points and time drains.

### Q2.1: Longest Step (Ranked)
> "Thinking about the entire quoting workflow you just described, which step takes you the longest?"

**Listen for**: Specific step name, rough time, reason it's slow

**Follow-ups**:
- "Why does that step take so long? Is it confusing UI, too many modals, too much typing?"
- "How long should it take ideally?"
- "How many times per day/week do you do this?"

### Q2.2: Most Frustrating
> "Which part of the quoting workflow is most *frustrating* for you? Not necessarily the slowest, but the most annoying."

**Listen for**:
- Confusing UX?
- Repeated actions?
- Unclear status?
- Modal fatigue?
- Unclear pricing?

**Follow-up**:
- "Why does that frustrate you?"
- "How would you change it if you could?"

### Q2.3: Most Confusing
> "Is there anything in Print Life's quoting that feels unclear or confusing? Anything you've had to figure out through trial and error?"

**Listen for**:
- Unclear field labels?
- Hidden workflows?
- Unexpected behavior?
- Status ambiguity?

### Q2.4: Error Recovery
> "Have you ever made a mistake while creating a quote (wrong customer, wrong price, wrong garment)? How hard was it to fix?"

**Listen for**:
- Can you edit a draft after saving?
- Can you duplicate and edit a previous quote?
- Do you have to start from scratch if you catch a mistake late?

### Q2.5: Repeated Actions
> "What parts of the quoting process feel repetitive? Do you find yourself doing the same thing over and over?"

**Listen for**:
- Repeat customers (should there be templates)?
- Repeat garments (should there be favorites)?
- Common quote structures (should there be presets)?

### Q2.6: Gaps/Missing Features

- Quote expiration/follow-up reminders?
- Competitor quote templates?
- Margin calculation or profitability check?

## Section 3: Interconnections (5 min)

**Goal**: Understand how quoting connects to other verticals in the workflow.

### Q3.1: Post-Quote Workflow
> "After a customer accepts a quote, what's the next step? How does it become a job?"

**Listen for**:
- Does it automatically convert to a job, or is that manual?
- Does a quote get turned into an invoice?
- Who approves the job (you, customer, team member)?
- What data flows from quote to job to invoice?

### Q3.2: Customer Info
> "When you're creating a quote, do you need to look up customer info (contact, address, order history)? Or is that already known?"

**Listen for**:
- Is customer selection hard or easy in Print Life?
- Do you need to add new customers often?
- Do you track customer history to inform pricing or messaging?

### Q3.3: Pricing Rules
> "How do you determine the pricing you put in a quote? Is there a pricing matrix or rate card you reference?"

**Listen for**:
- Spreadsheet, Print Life pricing table, mental math?
- Does it vary by customer, volume, garment type?
- Do you ever offer custom pricing or discounts?
- Would a configurable pricing matrix be valuable?

### Q3.4: Reporting
> "After you send quotes out, do you track them? Like, how many quotes do you send per week, what's your conversion rate (quotes → jobs)?"

**Listen for**:
- Does Print Life have reporting on this?
- Does 4Ink track this manually in a spreadsheet?
- Is this data important for understanding business health?

## Section 4: Wishlist & Ideal Workflow (5 min)

**Goal**: Understand what "10x better" means to Chris.

### Q4.1: Magic Wand
> "If you could wave a magic wand and redesign the quoting process in Print Life, what would change?"

**Listen for**: 1-3 core improvements they'd prioritize

### Q4.2: Specific Improvements
> "You mentioned [friction point from Q2] is frustrating. What would make that part faster or easier?"

**Listen for**: Concrete improvements to specific steps

### Q4.3: Time Savings
> "If we could reduce the time to create a quote from [current time] to [target time], what would be worth it? Would faster quoting meaningfully impact your business?"

**Listen for**:
- Is speed a real pain point, or is quality/accuracy more important?
- How many quotes do they create per week?
- What's the time savings worth in a week/month?

### Q4.4: Biggest Win
> "What's the single biggest win we could deliver in a new quoting system that would make you say 'wow, this is so much better'?"

**Listen for**: Core pain point they'd most value solving

---

## Section 5: Design Validation (3-5 min)

**Goal**: Get preliminary feedback on the design approach.

### Q5.1: Inline Editing
> "In our design, the entire quote form is one page with all fields visible at once — no modals, no multi-step wizard. Does that sound better than Print Life's current approach?"

**Listen for**: Enthusiastic or cautious? Any concerns?

### Q5.2: Real-Time Pricing
> "As you fill in quantity, colors, print locations, the pricing updates in real-time so you always see the total. Does that appeal to you?"

**Listen for**: Is this valuable, or do they prefer to manually control pricing?

### Q5.3: Keyboard Workflow
> "If we optimized the quote form so you could tab through all the fields without using your mouse, would that be useful?"

**Listen for**: Do they work fast and want efficiency, or is mouse fine?

---

## Closing (2 min)

> "Thank you so much. This is incredibly helpful. Before we dive into building, I'll synthesize this into a formal discovery document. We'll then share a design mockup with you for feedback before committing to the full implementation. Sound good?"
