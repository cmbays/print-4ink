## Conceptual Model — Lanes vs Tasks

This section explains the architectural shift from the old 6-stage production pipeline to the new universal board model.

### The Old Model (Replaced)

The original design used 6 production-specific columns as board stages: each column represented a specific production step. This broke down for non-screen-printing services (DTF, Embroidery) which have different production steps.

### The New Model: Universal Lanes + Service-Specific Tasks

**Lanes** represent work-in-progress status. They are universal across all service types:

| Lane | Meaning | Quote Context | Job Context |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Ready** | Logged, not started | New lead, need to build quote | Quote accepted, need to prep for production |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on | Drafting/building the quote | Production underway (screens, press, embroidery) |
| **Review** | Quality gate / approval pending | Customer reviewing our quote | QC check before shipping |
| **Blocked** | External dependency | Waiting on customer decision | Blanks not arrived, art revision needed |
| **Done** | Work complete, still tracking | Accepted → ready for job creation | Completed, may still need payment |

**Tasks** represent actual production steps within a lane. They are service-type-specific canonical checklists that auto-populate when a job is created:

| Service Type | Task Count | Example Tasks |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Screen Printing | 8 | Art files finalized, Film positives printed, Screens burned, Screens registered, Blanks received, Press run complete, QC passed, Packed |
| DTF | 6 | Art files finalized, Gang sheet prepared, DTF printed, Transfers pressed, QC passed, Packed |
| Embroidery | 7 | Art files finalized, Design digitized, Machine set up, Blanks received, Run complete, QC passed, Packed |

### Key Distinction

Production steps like screen burning and press runs happen **within the "In Progress" lane**, tracked by task checkboxes rather than separate board columns. The task progress bar on each card shows completion (e.g., "6/8 tasks"). This means the same 5-lane board works for all service types without different column configurations.

### Board Sections

The board has two horizontal rows sharing the same 5 vertical lanes:
- **Quotes row** (top): Quote cards and scratch notes
- **Jobs row** (bottom): Job cards

Cards move horizontally within their own row (quotes stay in quotes, jobs stay in jobs). Cards do not move between rows — a quote becomes a job via explicit conversion ("Create Job from Quote").

### Reference: Board Values

| Dimension | Values |
|-----------|--------|
| Lanes | Ready, In Progress, Review, Blocked, Done |
| Service Types | Screen Printing (blue), DTF (gold), Embroidery (green) |
| Risk Levels | On Track (no dot), Getting Tight (orange dot), At Risk (red dot) |
| Priority | Low, Medium, High, Rush |
| Card Types | Scratch Note, Quote Card, Job Card |
