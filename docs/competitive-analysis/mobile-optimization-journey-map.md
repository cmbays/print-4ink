## Journey Overview: Shop Operator Mobile Day

Based on industry research, a typical shop owner/operator touches their phone for shop management at these moments:

| Time | Context | Need | Journey Type |
|------|---------|------|-------------|
| 7:00 AM | Morning coffee, before shop | "What's on the schedule today?" | Mobile Check |
| 9:30 AM | On shop floor, at press | "What's the ink color spec for this job?" | Mobile Check |
| 11:00 AM | Customer calls | "Let me look up their order history" | Mobile Check |
| 12:30 PM | Lunch meeting with customer | "Let me give you a quick quote" | Mobile Action |
| 2:00 PM | Walking between stations | "Is the Smith order approved yet?" | Mobile Check |
| 3:30 PM | Customer texts mockup approval | "Let me update the job status" | Mobile Action |
| 5:30 PM | Leaving shop | "What's the status of everything?" | Mobile Check |
| 8:00 PM | At home, phone buzzes | "Payment received notification" | Push Notification |
| 9:00 PM | Planning tomorrow | "What jobs need to ship tomorrow?" | Mobile Check |

**Key insight**: 7 of 9 daily mobile touches are **quick checks** (< 30 seconds). The mobile experience must optimize for speed of information retrieval.

## Journey 1: "Morning Status Check" (Most Common)

### Current Experience (Competitor — Printavo)

```
Open phone browser → Type printavo.com → Wait for load (3-5s)
→ Login screen (if session expired) → Type email → Type password → Wait (2-3s)
→ Dashboard loads → Scroll to find today's schedule → Pinch-to-zoom on table
→ Tap a job → Wait for detail page → Scroll to find status
→ Back button → Repeat for next job

Total: 45-90 seconds per job check | Friction: HIGH
```

**Friction points**:
1. 🔴 No persistent session — must log in frequently
2. 🔴 Dashboard not optimized for mobile — requires pinch/zoom
3. 🟡 Tables unreadable on mobile — text too small
4. 🟡 No "today's jobs" quick view
5. 🟡 Multiple taps to reach job detail

### Current Experience (Printavo Native App)

```
Open Printavo app → App doesn't load → Force quit → Reopen → Still doesn't load
→ Give up, open browser instead → Same friction as web

Total: 60-120 seconds (if app works) or ABANDONED | Friction: CRITICAL
```

### Target Experience (Screen Print Pro — Phase 1)

```
Open browser → App loads instantly (cached shell)
→ Dashboard shows "Today's Jobs" card stack at top
→ See all job statuses at a glance (card per job with status badge)
→ Tap any card → Full detail slides in
→ Swipe back → Continue reviewing

Total: 5-10 seconds for full status overview | Friction: MINIMAL
```

### Target Experience (Screen Print Pro — Phase 2 PWA)

```
Tap home screen icon → App opens instantly (service worker)
→ Dashboard shows cached data immediately, live data loads in background
→ Push notification badge shows 2 updates
→ Glance at today's jobs → Done

Total: 3-5 seconds | Friction: NONE
```

### Current Experience (Competitors)

```
Customer calls → "Let me look up your order"
→ Open browser → Navigate to customer list → Search by name
→ Wait for results → Tap customer → Scroll to find orders
→ Tap order → Wait for detail → Read status to customer

Total: 30-60 seconds | Customer hears: "Hold on, let me find that..."
Friction: MODERATE (embarrassment factor — looks unprofessional)
```

### Target Experience (Screen Print Pro)

```
Customer calls → Tap "Customers" tab
→ Search bar auto-focused → Type first few letters → Results appear instantly
→ Tap customer → See order history with status badges
→ "Your order is in production, should ship Thursday"

```
Customer asks "How much for 100 tees, 2-color front?"
→ "Let me get back to you" (can't quote on phone)
→ OR: Open browser → Navigate to quotes → New quote form
→ Form is desktop-sized → Pinch/zoom → Miss fields → Mistype on tiny inputs
→ Calculate manually → Text/email customer later

Total: Deferred (hours/days) or 5-10 minutes of fumbling | Friction: HIGH
```

### Target Experience (Screen Print Pro — Phase 2)

```
Customer asks "How much for 100 tees, 2-color front?"
→ Tap "Quick Quote" from bottom tab
→ Large touch targets: Quantity slider → 100, Colors → 2, Locations → Front

Friction: NONE
```

## Journey 4: "Update Job Status on Shop Floor"

### Current Experience (Competitors)

```
Job finished printing → Walk to desk computer → Open browser → Find job → Update status
→ OR: Don't update until end of day (status tracking falls behind)

Total: 2-5 minutes per update | Friction: HIGH (physical interruption)
```

### Target Experience (Screen Print Pro)

```
Job finished printing → Pull phone from pocket
→ Tap "Jobs" → Find job (search or scroll cards) → Tap status badge
→ Select new status from bottom sheet → Confirmed with haptic feedback
→ Team notified automatically
