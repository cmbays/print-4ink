## 2. Happy Path Walkthrough — Creating a Job

### Step-by-Step Flow

| # | Action | Clicks | Notes |
|---|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Click "+ Quote" (or Sales > + Quote) | 1 | Top-level action, always accessible |
| 2 | Select or create customer | 1-3 | Search existing or "+ New Customer" |
| 3 | Add Line Items (garments) | 2+ | Search products, select sizes/quantities |
| 4 | Group into Line Item Groups (LIG) | 1-2 | Bundle by imprint/decoration type |
| 5 | Add Imprint info per LIG | 2-3 | Print location, pantone colors, thread counts |
| 6 | Upload mockups/artwork | 2-3 | "+ Mockup" button in imprint modal, drag-drop files |
| 7 | Apply pricing matrix | 2 | Select matrix + delineator, click "Refresh Pricing" |
| 8 | Add Details (dates, notes, PO#) | 3-5 | Customer Due Date, Production Due Date, notes |
| 9 | Save Quote | 1 | Quote created with default gray "Quote" status |
| 10 | Send for approval | 2-3 | Via messaging system or automation trigger |
| 11 | Customer approves | 0 | Customer clicks approve link in email |
| 12 | Status changes → Invoice | 1 (or auto) | Manual status change or automation |
| 13 | Move through production statuses | 1 per status | Each status change = 1 click or barcode scan |

**Estimated total clicks**: ~20-30 for full quote creation to production handoff

### Mobile App Flow (Simplified)

The mobile app uses a 3-step wizard:
1. **Sales > + Quote** → Select customer
2. **Line Items** tab → Add products
3. **Details** tab → Dates, notes → **Save**

---

## 3. Production Workflow

### 3.1 Status System

Statuses are the **core workflow engine**. They are:
- **Fully customizable** — name, color, order
- **Color-coded** — shops choose colors, typically by department
- **Binary type** — each status is either "Quote" or "Invoice" type
- **Default** — gray "Quote" status (not editable) is default for new quotes

**Typical Status Flow**:
```text
Quote (gray, default)
  → Quote Sent / Out for Approval
  → Quote Approved
  → Art Approved / Pre-Production
  → In Production / On Press
  → Quality Check
  → Ready for Pickup / Shipping
  → Completed / Delivered
  → Paid / Closed
```

**Configuration**: My Account > Customize Order Statuses
- Name, edit, delete statuses
- Select colors
- Set as "Quote" or "Invoice" type
- Reorder workflow sequence

**Key insight**: Statuses are "stopping points" — they represent waiting states:
- Waiting for department action
- Waiting for customer response
- Waiting for vendor/distributor
- Job complete

### 3.2 Calendar System

Three views with drag-and-drop scheduling:

| View | Granularity | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Monthly** | Day-level | Overview of entire month's schedule |
| **Weekly** | Hour-level | Detailed weekly planning |
| **Daily** | Hour-level | Granular daily scheduling |

**Key behaviors**:
- Dragging a job to a new date automatically updates **Production Due Date**
- Alert fires if Production Due Date is dragged past Customer Due Date (failsafe)
- Jobs appear on calendar based on configurable status trigger
- Tasks associated with a job visible when clicking the order on calendar

### 3.3 Dual Dates

Every order has TWO dates:

| Date | Purpose | Calendar Behavior |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Production Due Date** | When job should be produced | Drives calendar placement, updated by drag-drop |
| **Customer Due Date** | When customer expects delivery | Failsafe boundary, syncs to QuickBooks as "Due Date" |

Production Due Date should always be BEFORE Customer Due Date. This separation is critical for shops that need buffer time between production and delivery.

### 3.4 Power Scheduler (Premium Only)

A Gantt-style production board for multi-department tracking:

**Core Concept**: "Types of Work" — each decoration method (screen printing, embroidery, digital, finishing) is an independent workflow with custom steps.

**Configuration**:
- My Account > Workflow Customization > Types of Work
- Each Type of Work has custom steps and step statuses
- Types of Work are associated with Stations
- Can be preassigned to pricing matrices

**Scheduling Methods**:
1. Click "Date" cell → select from popup calendar
2. Click and drag imprint row onto a date row
3. Reschedule by dragging to new date

**Filters & Views**:
- Filter by dates, types of work, stations
- Save custom views (Super Admins can share views with all users)
- Track multiple decoration types on a single job simultaneously

**Key strength**: Shops with screen printing AND embroidery AND heat press can track all departments independently on one board.

### 3.5 Tasks & Preset Task Lists

**Tasks** are non-sequential action items (e.g., "Mix ink", "Set up screens", "Re-order blanks").

**Where tasks appear**:
- Calendar preview modal (click a job)
- "Tasks" tab on individual job
- Central "Tasks" tab in left sidebar

**Preset Task Lists**:
- Created at My Account > Preset Task List
- One-click application to any job
- Can be auto-applied via automation (e.g., when artwork approved → assign production task list)
- Each task can be assigned to specific users/departments

### 3.6 Automations

**Location**: My Account > Automation

**Available Triggers**:

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| If status changed to... | "Artwork Approved" |
| If all tasks in preset list completed... | All pre-press tasks done |
| If imprints added to Power Scheduler... | Work scheduled |
| If type of work step status changed... | Screen burning complete |
| If requested approval is approved... | Customer approved artwork |
| If quote/invoice paid in full... | Payment received |

**Available Actions**:

| Action | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Change status to... | Move to "In Production" |
| Send email and/or text to... | Notify customer of status |
| Apply preset task list... | Assign production tasks |
| Request payment for X%... | Request 50% deposit |
| Request approval... | Send artwork for approval |

**Key behavior**: One trigger can fire MULTIPLE actions. Example chain:
1. Trigger: Customer approves quote
2. Actions: Change status to "Quote Approved" + Request 50% payment + Assign production task list

### 3.7 Barcoding (Premium)

- QR codes built into every quote/invoice
- Scan with phone camera or barcode scanner
- Pulls up job details instantly
- Departments can scan to update status, check artwork, log defects
- Enables hands-free status tracking on production floor

### 3.8 Customer-Facing Features

**Customer Portal**:
- View all orders, quotes, artwork approvals, account balance
- Enlarge artwork files from public invoice view
- Approve quotes and artwork via email links

**Approval Types**:
- Quote Approval (pricing/scope)
- Artwork Approval (mockups/proofs)
- Approvals can be separated or combined
- Created at My Account > Approvals
- Sent via messaging system or automated

**Messaging System**:
- Accessible on every quote
- Hosts all order details and communications
- Thread-based per order
- Supports shortcodes for dynamic content

### 3.9 Shortcodes (Template Variables)

Dynamic content injection for emails/messages:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Customer | `[customer-full-name]`, `[customer-company-name]`, `[customer-email-address]` |
| Invoice | `[invoice-id]`, `[invoice-status]`, `[invoice-nickname]`, `[invoice-public-url]` |
| Owner | `[invoice-owner-first-name]`, `[invoice-owner-email-address]` |
| Payment | `[payment-request-amount]` |
| Address | `[invoice-shipping-address]`, `[invoice-billing-address]` |
| Custom | `[work-order-public-url]` |

### 3.10 Purchase Orders & Receiving (Premium)

- Create and share purchase orders
- **Receiving** tracks goods against POs
- Bulk and partial receiving options
- Smart filters: "Needs to Receive" / "Received"
- Color coding: Yellow = partially received, Green = fully received
- "Managed Goods" tab organizes all purchasing/receiving tools

### 3.11 Analytics & Reporting

- Located under Financials > Analytics > Revenue & Expenses
- Total sales tracking (paid and unpaid)
- Sales by status, by owner, by date range
- Sales tax reporting
- Expense tracking per job and per shop
- Profit/loss per individual order
- Charts: sales by date, employee, invoice status

## 6. Friction Points

### Critical

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Accounting inaccuracies** | Doesn't handle customer overpayments, sales tax reporting has "horror stories", QuickBooks sync requires manual review of every invoice |
| **Payment processor lock-in** | Removed all third-party payment processors after VC buyout; only their in-house processor remains |
| **Mobile app reliability** | Periods where app won't open for months; won't load on some current iPhones |

### High

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **No role-based permissions** | No read/write permission system; problematic for shops with 20+ employees |
| **PO/Receiving limitations** | Must receive entire order at once — no shortage/overage handling |
| **No third-party brokerage** | Can't manage outsourced/brokered orders |
| **Slow feature development** | Known for promising fixes and ignoring them "for literally years" |

### Medium

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Status skipping bypasses automations** | Jumping statuses means associated automations don't fire |
| **Mobile editing bugs** | Editing jobs in app adds zeros to unfilled columns, auto-adds print locations |
| **No automated job run times** | Can't automatically assign production time estimates |
| **Limited customization** | Users want more workflow and UI customization options |
| **Power Scheduler premium-only** | Core production feature locked behind highest tier |

### Low

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Scalability ceiling** | Works well for small shops; users report outgrowing it at 20-30 people |
| **InkSoft integration fragmented** | Separate subscriptions despite shared parent company; separate logins |

---

## 8. Key Insights for Screen Print Pro

### What to Learn From

1. **Status-centric workflow is the right model** — Printavo proves that customizable, color-coded statuses are the heart of shop management. Every feature (calendar, automations, scheduler) connects through statuses.

2. **Dual dates are essential** — Production Due Date vs. Customer Due Date is universally needed. The drag-drop failsafe (alert when production > customer date) is elegant.

3. **Automation = status triggers + action chains** — The trigger/action model (status change → email + task list + payment request) is powerful and shops love it. This should be a core feature, not premium.

4. **Preset task lists solve consistency** — Shops need repeatable checklists per job type. One-click application + automation integration makes this frictionless.

5. **Line Item Groups with imprint separation** — Grouping garments by decoration method and attaching mockups/pricing per group is the right data model for multi-decoration jobs.

6. **Barcode/QR scanning on production floor** — Physical-digital bridge is crucial for production tracking. Phone camera scanning is minimum viable; dedicated scanners are better.

7. **Types of Work for multi-department tracking** — Screen printing ≠ embroidery ≠ digital. Independent workflows per decoration type is a must-have for mature shops.

### What to Do Better

1. **Role-based permissions from Day 1** — Printavo's biggest architectural gap. Design user roles (Owner, Manager, Artist, Press Operator, Shipping) with granular permissions early.

2. **Better financial accuracy** — Use proper money arithmetic (we already have `big.js`). Accurate sales tax, overpayment tracking, and QuickBooks sync quality.

3. **Partial receiving/shortage handling** — Real shops deal with shorted orders constantly. Track partial receipts, overages, and substitutions per PO line item.

4. **Desktop-first, mobile-parity** — Printavo's mobile app is unreliable. Build responsive-first but ensure core flows work perfectly on desktop where production managers actually live.

5. **Don't gate production features behind premium** — Power Scheduler (production tracking) is a core need, not a luxury. Make basic production tracking available at all tiers.

6. **Faster status change (fewer clicks)** — Consider keyboard shortcuts, bulk status changes, and production-floor-optimized views with large touch targets.

7. **Brokerage/outsource tracking** — Support jobs that are partially or fully outsourced to contract printers. This is a gap competitors haven't solved either.

8. **Smart scheduling with capacity** — Printavo's calendar is date-based but doesn't track press capacity, estimated run times, or utilization. Add capacity-aware scheduling.

9. **Thread-per-topic messaging** — Printavo's per-order messaging is good but flat. Consider structured communication threads (artwork feedback, shipping questions, payment issues) within each job.

10. **Offline-capable production floor** — WiFi in shops is unreliable. Consider offline barcode scanning with sync-when-connected for production floor status updates.
