# Print Life — Quoting Journey Map

**Purpose**: Document Print Life's actual quoting workflow with friction points to inform Screen Print Pro design
**Input**: Playwright exploration of 4Ink customer portal + user interview with 4Ink operator
**Status**: Complete

---

## Terminology: Internal vs External Quoting

| Term | Definition | Phase |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Internal Quote** | Shop operator builds quote for customer using `/quotes/new`. Shop controls pricing and sends final quote. | **Phase 1** (building now) |
| **External Quote** | Customer submits quote request via customer portal. Shop reviews, adjusts, approves. | **Phase 2** |
| **Hybrid Approval** | Customer self-service + shop approval gate. | **Phase 2** (shop-side status tracking in Phase 1) |

**Note**: The journey below documents Print Life's **internal quoting** flow (what 4Ink actually uses). Print Life also has a customer portal, but 4Ink doesn't use it. Our Phase 1 redesigns internal quoting. Phase 2 adds external quoting with hybrid approval.

## Journey Overview

### Simple Quote: 1 Garment, 1 Color, Size Breakdown

**Measured**:
- Clicks: ~20-30
- Time: ~10 minutes
- Friction Level: High
- Primary Pain Points: Blocking recalculation, mandatory unused steps, forced color swatches

### Complex Quote: 3 Garments, Multiple Colors, Size Breakdowns, Multiple Locations

**Estimated**:
- Clicks: ~40-60+
- Time: ~15-20 minutes
- Friction Level: Very High
- Primary Pain Points: All simple quote issues multiplied, plus rebuild-from-scratch for each garment

## Detailed Journey: Simple Quote

```text
START: Customer calls/emails requesting 50 black tees with front print
  ↓
STEP 1: ADD ITEMS (/builder/quote/product-list)
  • User sees: Product catalog grid (12 items), search bar, filter sidebar
  • User does: Search/browse → click product → modal opens → pick color → ADD ITEM
  • Friction: Color grid is 103 tiny swatches, no search, no filter
  • Time: ~1-2 min
  ↓
STEP 2: SELECT QTY (/builder/quote/product-quantity)
  • User sees: Full color swatch grid (top), size/qty table (bottom)
  • User does: Enter qty per size (S:10, M:25, L:15, XL:5)
  • Friction: ⚠️ CRITICAL — Each qty entry triggers slow recalculation.
    Cannot tab to next field until recalc finishes. Blocks rapid data entry.
  • Time: ~2-3 min (should be 30 seconds)
  ↓
STEP 3: ADD ART (/builder/quote/print-specs)
  • User sees: 5 location buttons (Front, Back, L Sleeve, R Sleeve, Neck Label)
  • User does: Click ADD FRONT → upload artwork → forced to pick ink color swatches
  • Friction: Color swatch selection is unnecessary for 4Ink's workflow.
    Switching decoration style RESETS all uploaded art and selections.
  • Time: ~1-2 min
  ↓
STEP 4: CHOOSE INK STYLE
  • User sees: Decoration method options
  • User does: Skip/placeholder — 4Ink doesn't use this step
  • Friction: ⚠️ MANDATORY but unused. Cannot skip. Adds clicks.
  • Time: ~30 sec (wasted)
  ↓
STEP 5: SELECT FINISHING
  • User sees: Finishing options
  • User does: Skip/placeholder — 4Ink doesn't use this step
  • Friction: ⚠️ MANDATORY but unused. Cannot skip. Adds clicks.
  • Time: ~30 sec (wasted)
  ↓
STEP 6: PROJECT OVERVIEW
  • User sees: Quote summary with all selections
  • User does: Review → submit/save
  • Friction: Unknown (not fully explored via Playwright)
  • Time: ~1-2 min
  ↓
END: Quote built internally → immediately becomes invoice → price communicated via phone call
  • NO quote status tracking (pending/sent/accepted)
  • NO saved quote for future reuse
  • NO customer notification system
```

**Total: ~10 minutes, ~20-30 clicks**

## Detailed Journey: Complex Quote

```text
START: Customer wants 3 garment types, multiple colors, full size breakdowns, front + back print
  ↓
GARMENT 1: Repeat Steps 1-5 above (~8-10 min)
  ↓
Click "+ PROJECT" to add second garment
  ↓
GARMENT 2: Repeat Steps 1-5 (~6-8 min, slightly faster with familiarity)
  ↓
Click "+ PROJECT" to add third garment
  ↓
GARMENT 3: Repeat Steps 1-5 (~6-8 min)
  ↓
STEP 6: PROJECT OVERVIEW — Review all garments
  ↓
END: Quote built → invoice → phone call
```

**Total: ~15-20 minutes, ~40-60+ clicks**

## Friction Point Inventory

| # | Friction Point | Step(s) | Severity | Why It Matters | Our Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Qty fields block on recalculation** | Step 2 | Critical | Adds 2-3 min per quote, breaks flow | Instant client-side calculation, never block input |
| 2 | **Mandatory steps can't be skipped** | Steps 4-5 | High | 1+ min wasted per quote on unused steps | Configurable steps, skip what's not needed |
| 3 | **Art style change resets all selections** | Step 3 | High | Causes data loss, forces re-upload | Non-destructive editing, preserve all data |
| 4 | **Color swatch grid overwhelming** | Steps 1-2 | Medium | 103 swatches with no search | Searchable color picker with favorites |
| 5 | **Forced art color swatch selection** | Step 3 | Medium | Unnecessary for shop's workflow | Make optional or remove |
| 6 | **No quote reuse/duplication** | Post-flow | High | Rebuild from scratch every time | "Duplicate Quote" + customer quote history |
| 7 | **No quote tracking** | Post-flow | High | Quotes lost in emails/calls | Status dashboard: draft/sent/accepted/declined |
| 8 | **No approval workflow** | Post-flow | High | Can't use customer self-service | Hybrid: customer submits → shop approves |
| 9 | **No keyboard navigation** | All steps | Low | Mouse-only, slower workflow | Tab navigation, keyboard shortcuts |
| 10 | **Session state lost on navigation** | All steps | Medium | Lose progress if browser navigates | Auto-save draft, URL-based state |

## Interconnections with Other Workflows

### Quote → Invoice Conversion
- **Current (4Ink)**: Quote IS the invoice. No separate quote state. Once built, it's an invoice.
- **Pain**: No ability to send a quote for approval before creating an invoice. Quote and invoice are conflated.
- **Our approach**: Separate Quote and Invoice entities. Quote → Approve → Convert to Invoice.

### Quote → Customer Communication
- **Current**: Shop calls customer on phone with the price
- **Pain**: No digital trail, no PDF, no email, no portal link
- **Our approach**: Send quote via email/portal link. Customer can view, accept, or request changes.

### Quote → Repeat Orders
- **Current**: Rebuild from scratch every time
- **Pain**: 10 minutes wasted per repeat order
- **Our approach**: Save quotes per customer. "Duplicate Quote" button. Quote templates.

### Customer Data in Quoting
- **Current**: Guest mode in customer portal, internal quoting has customer selection
- **Pain**: No CRM integration in quoting flow
- **Our approach**: Customer combobox in quote form, link to customer history

## Time Distribution (Measured)

**Simple Quote Breakdown (10 minutes)**:
| Activity | Time | % of Total | Could Be |
|----------|------|-----------|----------|
| Product search + selection | ~1-2 min | 15% | 30 sec (better search) |
| Color selection | ~30 sec | 5% | 10 sec (searchable picker) |
| Qty/size entry | ~2-3 min | 25% | 30 sec (instant calc) |
| Art upload + color swatches | ~1-2 min | 15% | 45 sec (skip forced swatches) |
| Skip unused steps (Ink/Finishing) | ~1 min | 10% | 0 sec (eliminate) |
| Review + submit | ~1-2 min | 15% | 1 min (cleaner summary) |
| Waiting for recalculations | ~1-2 min | 15% | 0 sec (instant) |
| **Total** | **~10 min** | **100%** | **~3-4 min** |

## Handoff to Designers

**Key Design Principles from Analysis**:
1. **Never block input** — calculations happen instantly in the background, never prevent typing
2. **Eliminate friction steps** — only show steps the shop actually uses
3. **Non-destructive editing** — changing one option never wipes other selections
4. **Keyboard-first data entry** — tab through all fields without mouse
5. **Persistent state** — auto-save drafts, URL-based state, never lose work

**Must-Haves for New Design**:
- [ ] Instant, non-blocking price calculations (Phase 1)
- [ ] Configurable/skippable steps (no mandatory unused steps) (Phase 1)
- [ ] Quote status tracking dashboard (draft/sent/accepted/declined) (Phase 1)
- [ ] Quote duplication for repeat customers (Phase 1)
- [ ] Hybrid approval workflow (customer submits → shop reviews → approves) (Phase 2 — shop-side status tracking in Phase 1)
- [ ] Price override before customer sees final quote (Phase 1)
- [ ] Keyboard-navigable quantity entry (Phase 1)

**Nice-to-Haves**:
- [ ] Searchable color picker (vs. 103-swatch grid)
- [ ] Customer quote history (all past quotes for a customer)
- [ ] Quote templates for common orders
- [ ] Quick-quote mode (minimal fields for phone quotes)
