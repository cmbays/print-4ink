## Key Insights for Screen Print Pro

### What the Market Does Well (Table Stakes)

1. **Customer profiles with core fields**: Name, company, email, phone, address -- every competitor has this
2. **Order history per customer**: All platforms maintain order history
3. **Some form of customer portal**: 7 of 9 competitors offer customer-facing portals (Kothari and GraphicsFlow are exceptions due to different focus areas)
4. **QuickBooks integration**: The most common accounting integration across the industry
5. **Tax-exempt handling**: Most platforms support tax exemption at some level
6. **Notes system**: Both internal and customer-facing notes are standard

### What the Market Does Poorly (Our Opportunities)

1. **Customer-level tags and segmentation**: Most platforms have order-level tags but NOT customer-level tags. InkSoft is the exception with proper customer tags. This is an opportunity to build tags, groups, and custom fields at the customer level.
2. **Multi-contact management**: While supported, most platforms handle this poorly. Only OMG has role-based contacts (Orders/Art/Billing). This is a clear opportunity.
3. **Customer-specific pricing defaults**: Only DecoNetwork has sophisticated customer-tier pricing (Contract Price Levels). Most others handle discounts per-order only. Opportunity to set default pricing rules per customer.
4. **Smart CSV import**: Only DecoNetwork does smart record matching on import (by ID/email/login). Printavo duplicates records on import. Opportunity to build intelligent deduplication.
5. **Communication history**: While most platforms log communications, few present them in a unified timeline. Printavo's activity feed is closest, but it's order-centric, not customer-centric.
6. **Credit management**: Almost no platform handles credit limits or payment term enforcement. ShopWorks is the only one with real A/R management (built-in accounting). Opportunity to add credit limit warnings/enforcement.
7. **Custom fields**: Only DecoNetwork supports custom customer fields. Every shop has unique data they want to track (e.g., "shirt size for free samples", "preferred printer", "referred by"). Major opportunity.

### Standout Features to Consider

| Feature | Source | Relevance |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Customer-stored billing (saved cards) | Printavo | High -- reduces payment friction |
| Contract Price Levels (customer tiers) | DecoNetwork | High -- eliminates per-order discount entry |
| Role-based contacts (Orders/Art/Billing) | OMG | High -- routes communications correctly |
| Client vs. Prospect auto-classification | InkSoft | Medium -- automatic lead qualification |
| Lead scoring and sales funnel | ShopWorks | Low for Phase 1, high for growth |
| Custom customer fields | DecoNetwork | High -- every shop has unique needs |
| Smart CSV import with deduplication | DecoNetwork | High -- critical for migration |
| Automated reorder reminders | Printavo | High -- drives repeat business |
| Sales team assignment per company | DecoNetwork | Medium -- useful for multi-person shops |
| Customer sales summary popup (hover) | DecoNetwork | Medium -- quick customer context |
| Public Profile URL (no login) | Printavo | Medium -- frictionless customer access |
| Art Approval event timeline | GraphicsFlow | Medium -- audit trail for disputes |

### Recommended Feature Prioritization for Screen Print Pro

**CORE (Must Have)**:
1. Customer profile: name, company, email, phone, address (billing + shipping), tax-exempt status
2. Company/contact hierarchy with multiple contacts per company
3. Contact roles: Primary, Billing, Art/Design, Shipping
4. Customer notes: internal (shop-only) + customer-facing
5. Order history, quote history, payment history per customer
6. Search and filter: by name, company, status, tags
7. Tags: customer-level custom tags for segmentation
8. CSV import with smart deduplication (match by email)
9. CSV export of customer data
10. QuickBooks Online sync (customers, invoices, payments)

**PERIPHERAL (Should Have)**:
1. Payment terms per customer (Net 30, Due on Receipt, etc.)
2. Customer-specific default discount percentage
3. Custom fields (admin-defined, per customer)
4. Customer portal: view quotes, orders, approve artwork, make payments
5. Communication timeline (unified view of all interactions)
6. Tax settings per customer (rate override, exemption certificate reference)
7. Automated notifications at order status changes
8. Reorder suggestions based on past order patterns

**INTERCONNECTIONS**:
- Quoting: customer selected on quote; quote history visible on customer profile
- Invoicing: payment terms from customer profile auto-applied
- Artwork approval: art contacts notified; approval status on customer timeline
- Production: production notes reference customer preferences
- Reporting: customer value, order frequency, payment history reports
