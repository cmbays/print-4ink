## 2. Key Friction Points Across Both Competitors

### What Neither Does Well

1. **No production board accessible to all users** — Printavo gates their board behind $399/mo Premium tier. PrintLife has a board but it's fixed-structure with no urgency indicators. Neither provides the at-a-glance production awareness that shop owners need.

2. **No capacity awareness whatsoever** — Neither product tracks capacity, warns about overbooking, or helps with delivery date commitments. This is the single biggest gap in the market.

3. **No quality gates** — Neither has an explicit QC checkpoint before shipping. The 4Ink embroidery story (shipped bad work twice) illustrates why this matters.

4. **No "what do I work on today?" view** — Printavo's calendar shows everything; PrintLife's board shows everything. Neither helps filter to today's priorities.

5. **No blocked-item tracking** — Neither has a concept of "this job can't proceed because of an external dependency." Jobs just sit in their current stage with no visibility into why.

6. **No quick capture** — Both require starting a full quote form to log a new opportunity. No lightweight "don't forget this" mechanism.

7. **No production analytics** — Printavo has 9 analytics reports, all financial. PrintLife has basic reports. Neither tracks throughput, cycle time, on-time delivery, or capacity utilization.

8. **No screen room tracking** — Neither tracks screen prep (mesh count, emulsion, burn status). This is a critical gap for screen printing shops specifically.

### Printavo-Specific Friction

- **Calendar-centric, not production-centric** — Default landing page is a calendar, not a production dashboard
- **Everything on one page for quotes** — No validation, no guardrails, can save empty quotes
- **Power Scheduler gated behind Premium** — Core production feature locked at highest tier
- **Financial accuracy issues** — User reviews cite accounting bugs, sales tax problems
- **Mobile app unreliable** — Periods of non-functionality reported
- **Automation skipping** — Jumping statuses bypasses automation chain

### PrintLife-Specific Friction

- **Quote = Invoice** — No separate entities, can't track quote pipeline independently
- **Blocking recalculation** — 2-3 min wasted per quote on server-side recalc
- **Mandatory wizard steps** — Ink Style and Finishing required even when unused
- **Single Production stage** — No sub-stages for screen prep, QC, etc.
- **No urgency indicators** — Board shows no due dates, no color-coding for risk
- **Single-user only** — No staff accounts or assignment capability
- **Fixed lane structure** — Can't customize stages to match shop's actual workflow

## 3. What Each Competitor Does Well (Adopt or Improve)

### From Printavo — Adopt These Patterns

| Pattern                                   | Why It Works                                           | Our Adaptation                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dual dates** (Production + Customer)    | Separates internal scheduling from customer commitment | Adopt directly + add start date                                         |
| **Automation chains** (trigger → actions) | Eliminates manual busywork at status transitions       | Task completion drives state changes instead of status-triggered chains |
| **Preset task lists**                     | Ensures no step gets skipped                           | Canonical tasks per service type, auto-applied on lane entry            |
| **Color-coded statuses**                  | Instant visual scan                                    | Color-code by service type (more useful than by status)                 |
| **Line Item Groups + Imprints**           | Flexible data model for multi-decoration jobs          | Adopt for job detail view                                               |
| **Production Notes vs Customer Notes**    | Internal/external separation                           | Adopt — notes feed with visibility flags                                |
| **"Getting Started" onboarding**          | Guides new users through setup                         | Adopt for first-time board experience                                   |

### From PrintLife — Adopt These Patterns

| Pattern                              | Why It Works                     | Our Adaptation                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Kanban dashboard as primary view** | Production-first thinking        | Board is our primary view, not calendar                                  |
| **Substage tabs within lanes**       | Granularity without complexity   | Sub-stage indicators within universal lanes                              |
| **Auto-email on mockup submission**  | Removes manual follow-up         | Expand to configurable notifications at any transition                   |
| **Delivery-date organization**       | Simple, effective prioritization | Due date + risk indicator on every card                                  |
| **4-lane left-to-right flow**        | Matches physical production flow | Adapt to universal lanes (Ready → In Progress → Review → Blocked → Done) |

## 4. Our Differentiation — What Neither Competitor Offers

### Tier 1: Core Differentiators (Must Have for Launch)

1. **Universal board with service type awareness** — One board that handles Screen Printing, DTF, and Embroidery with visual service type indicators
2. **Blocked lane with dependency tracking** — Explicit tracking of external blockers
3. **Quality gate (Review lane)** — Mandatory QC checkpoint before Done
4. **Quick capture (scratch notes)** — Lightweight "don't forget this" → Create Quote
5. **Today filter** — Start-date-based filtering to focus on today's work
6. **Due date risk indicators** — Color-coded warnings based on proximity + estimated work

### Tier 2: Capacity Intelligence (Key Differentiator)

7. **What-if date picker** — Pick a potential due date, see the work landscape
8. **Conservative overbooking warnings** — Only when highly confident, never false positives
9. **Complexity scoring** — Beyond quantity: locations, screen count, garment variety
10. **Inferred productivity tracking** — Daily output from state transitions, not manual logging

### Tier 3: Workflow Automation

11. **Task checklists drive state changes** — Complete all tasks → card eligible for next lane
12. **Quote → Job auto-generation** — Accepted quote creates Job card (configurable: auto or manual gate)
13. **Notification on card events** — Email + in-app bell for approvals, blocks, completions
14. **End-of-day summary** — Optional productivity celebration
