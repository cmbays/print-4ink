# Screen Print Pro — Implementation Plan

**Current Phase**: Phase 1.5 — Demo Prep (Feb 15-21)
**Demo Date**: February 21, 2026

---

## Build Principles

1. **Shape Up methodology**: Shaping → Betting → Building → Cool-down cycles
2. **7-step vertical pipeline**: Discovery → Scope → Breadboard → Implementation Planning → Build → Review → Demo
3. **Parallel execution**: Multiple verticals built concurrently via git worktrees + subagent-driven development
4. **Breadboard-first**: Every vertical gets a breadboard before the first line of code
5. **User review checkpoints**: Demo with Gary (shop owner) to validate design decisions

---

## Phase 1: Frontend Mockups (COMPLETE)

All 7 verticals built and demo-ready. 529 tests passing, 26 test files, zero rollbacks.

### Demo Week Schedule

| Day      | Deliverable                                                   | Risk Level                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Day 1    | Cool-down: fix stale docs, triage issues, update Gary tracker | **Done**                                    |
| Day 2    | Mobile polish (Sprints 3-4): forms, detail views, animation   | **Done** (PRs #148, #167, #174, #175)       |
| Days 2-3 | Demo bug fixes (#128, #129, #138)                             | **Done** (PR #157)                          |
| Days 3-4 | Onboarding Wizards (#145)                                     | Pending                                     |
| Days 4-5 | DTF Gang Sheet Builder — discovery through build              | **Done** (PRs #232, #237, #249, #280, #284) |
| Day 6+   | Minimal backend (stretch)                                     | High                                        |

### Demo-Blocking Bugs (ALL RESOLVED)

| Issue | Title                               | Status              |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| #128  | Price matrix: leading zeros         | **Fixed** (PR #157) |
| #129  | Price matrix: defer tier validation | **Fixed** (PR #157) |
| #138  | Price matrix: color pricing doubles | **Fixed** (PR #157) |

### Demo Journeys (Wizard-Guided)

1. **View the job board** — walk through Kanban, understand production flow
2. **Close an invoice** — full financial cycle: view → record payment → mark paid
3. **Create a customer** — demonstrate CRM capability and cross-linking

### Mockup Integration

- Auto-generate garment mockups and attach to quotes when sending
- Wire thumbnails into Job Detail, Kanban Board, Quote Detail
- Replaces Gary's current manual process (create mockup image → email to customer)

---

## Phase 2: Feedback Iteration + Backend Foundation (NOT STARTED)

**Shaped during cool-down, not yet bet on.**

### Shaped Pitches

- Process Gary's demo feedback into vertical BRIEFs
- Backend horizontal: Supabase setup, auth, data model, API patterns (#84)
- Quoting vertical backend (reference implementation)
- New agents: Backend Architect (#119), Data Engineer (#120), Schema Migration (#121)
- TDD skill for Phase 2 (#122)
- Build pipeline upgrade (#123)
- Sentry error monitoring (#86)

### Open Strategic Questions

- Backend scope: one vertical at a time or horizontal foundation first? → **Decided: horizontal first** (ROADMAP.md)
- Mobile path: responsive → PWA → native (phased)
- Multi-user timing: depends on Gary feedback

---

## Phase 3: Production App (NOT SCOPED)

All verticals connected to real backend. Real-time updates, multi-user support.

## Phase 4: Mobile (NOT SCOPED)

Native mobile app on app stores. Will be shaped after Phase 3.

## Deferred Tech Debt

Tracked as GitHub issues. Prioritized during cool-down cycles.
