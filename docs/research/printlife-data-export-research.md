# The Print Life Data Export Research

**Research Date**: February 10, 2026
**Researcher**: Claude (Screen Print Pro Development Team)
**Purpose**: Investigate The Print Life's pricing data export capabilities to support import functionality in Screen Print Pro

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding**: The Print Life software **does not appear to have documented CSV export functionality** for pricing data. After extensive research including web searches, documentation review, and competitor analysis, no evidence was found of native pricing matrix export features in The Print Life.

**Critical Implications for Screen Print Pro**:

1. Direct PrintLife → Screen Print Pro data migration via file export is **not currently feasible**
2. 4Ink will likely need to **manually recreate their pricing configuration** in Screen Print Pro
3. Alternative workarounds exist but require manual effort or technical extraction techniques
4. Screen Print Pro should prioritize **intuitive manual pricing setup** over import functionality

---

### 6. Industry Standard Pricing Data Format

#### Common Pricing Structure

Based on industry research ([sources](https://www.printavo.com/blog/screen-printing-pricing-matrix), [screenprintdirect.com](https://screenprintdirect.com/pages/pricing-calculator)):

**Standard Pricing Dimensions**:

1. **Quantity Tiers** (e.g., 12-23, 24-35, 36-47, 48-71, 72+)
2. **Number of Colors** (1 color, 2 colors, 3 colors, etc.)
3. **Print Locations** (front, back, sleeve, etc.)
4. **Setup Fees** (per color, per location)
5. **Garment Cost** (wholesale price + markup)

**Typical Formula** ([source](https://www.printavo.com/blog/screen-printing-pricing/)):

```
Finished Price = Blank Product Price + Print Price
Print Price = Setup Charges + (Per-Item Print Cost × Quantity)
Industry Markup = 150-200% of wholesale garment cost
```

**Common Data Points** ([source](https://exiletech.com/blog/screen-printing-cost-calculator/)):

- Quantity of screens needed
- Total cost per location
- Quantity of locations on garment
- Total cost per color
- Quantity of colors on garment
- Total garment cost
- Garment shipping cost
- Desired profit per shirt
- Total garment order quantity

#### No Universal Standard

**Key Finding**: There is **no industry-standard file format** for screen printing pricing data.

Each platform uses its own CSV structure:

- Printavo: Excel-based matrix with specific template
- YoPrint: Custom CSV template with their field structure
- InkSoft: Proprietary pricing grid
- The Print Life: Unknown/undocumented

**Implication**: Screen Print Pro must define its own import format or support multiple formats.

---

const rows = Array.from(table.querySelectorAll('tr'))
const csv = rows
  .map((row) =>
    Array.from(row.querySelectorAll('td, th'))
      .map((cell) => `"${cell.innerText}"`)
      .join(',')
  )
  .join('\n')
console.log(csv)
// User can copy output to clipboard

## Recommendations for Screen Print Pro

### Priority 1: Intuitive Manual Pricing Setup (MUST HAVE)

Since PrintLife export isn't available, focus on making manual pricing entry **fast and painless**.

**Design Principles**:

1. **Guided Workflow**: Step-by-step wizard for pricing setup
2. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-populate common industry values
3. **Templates**: Provide 2-3 starter templates (basic, standard, premium)
4. **Visual Preview**: Show pricing matrix as user builds it
5. **Bulk Editing**: Allow copying rows, filling patterns
6. **Validation**: Real-time checks for missing tiers, overlapping ranges

**User Flow**:

```
Setup Wizard:
1. Choose decoration method (screen print, DTF, embroidery)
2. Define quantity breaks (12, 24, 48, 72, 144+)
3. Set color pricing (1-6 colors)
4. Configure location pricing (front, back, sleeve)
5. Add setup fees (per color, per location)
6. Preview & test with sample quote
7. Save & activate
```

**Success Metric**: User can configure basic pricing matrix in < 10 minutes.

---

### Priority 2: CSV Import from Template (SHOULD HAVE)

Provide CSV import for **power users** who want to build pricing offline or migrate from competitors.

**Implementation**:

1. Offer downloadable CSV template with clear instructions
2. Support multiple tab-separated sections: quantity tiers, color pricing, location pricing, setup fees
3. Robust validation with helpful error messages
4. Preview imported data before committing
5. Allow partial imports (e.g., just update quantity tiers)

**Example Template** (simplified):

```csv
# Quantity Breaks
quantity_min,quantity_max,base_multiplier
12,23,1.00
24,47,0.85
48,71,0.75
72,143,0.65
144,999,0.55

# Color Pricing (per piece)
colors,additional_cost
1,0.00
2,1.00
3,1.75
4,2.25
5,2.75
6,3.25

# Setup Fees
type,fee
per_color,25.00
per_location,15.00
rush_job,50.00
```

**Success Metric**: User can import 100-row pricing matrix in < 2 minutes with zero errors.

---

### Priority 3: QuickBooks Validation (NICE TO HAVE)

For users migrating from Print Life who sync to QuickBooks:

**Feature**: "Validate Pricing Against QB Invoices"

1. Import QuickBooks invoice data (optional)
2. Compare quoted prices in Screen Print Pro vs historical QB prices
3. Flag discrepancies for review
4. Help user ensure pricing continuity

**Use Case**: User sets up pricing in Screen Print Pro manually, then validates against 6 months of QB invoices to catch mistakes.

**Success Metric**: 95% of validated quotes match historical pricing within 5%.

---

### Priority 4: Browser Extension Data Scraper (FUTURE)

**Long-term Consideration**: Build a Chrome extension that extracts pricing data from The Print Life (or other competitors).

**How It Works**:

1. User installs "Screen Print Pro Importer" Chrome extension
2. User logs into The Print Life
3. Extension detects pricing screens
4. User clicks "Extract Pricing Data"
5. Extension scrapes HTML tables, converts to Screen Print Pro format
6. User downloads JSON or CSV
7. User imports into Screen Print Pro

**Challenges**:

- ⚠️ Brittle (breaks when Print Life changes HTML)
- ⚠️ Legal/ToS concerns (scraping competitor data)
- ⚠️ Maintenance burden (updates for each Print Life release)

**Recommendation**: **Deprioritize** until user demand justifies investment. Focus on Priority 1-2 first.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Recommended Import File Format

**Option A: Single CSV with Sections** (simpler for users)

```csv
[QUANTITY_BREAKS]
min,max,multiplier
12,23,1.00
24,47,0.85

[COLOR_PRICING]
colors,additional_per_piece
1,0.00
2,1.00

[SETUP_FEES]
fee_type,amount
per_color,25.00
per_location,15.00
```

**Option B: Multiple CSV Files** (more flexible)

```
pricing-import/
  ├── quantity-breaks.csv
  ├── color-pricing.csv
  ├── location-pricing.csv
  └── setup-fees.csv
```

**Option C: JSON** (most structured, harder for users)

```json
{
  "pricing_matrix": {
    "name": "Standard Screen Print",
    "quantity_breaks": [
      { "min": 12, "max": 23, "multiplier": 1.0 },
      { "min": 24, "max": 47, "multiplier": 0.85 }
    ],
    "color_pricing": [
      { "colors": 1, "additional_cost": 0.0 },
      { "colors": 2, "additional_cost": 1.0 }
    ],
    "setup_fees": {
      "per_color": 25.0,
      "per_location": 15.0
    }
  }
}
```

**Recommendation**: Support **Option A (sectioned CSV)** for simplicity + **Option C (JSON)** for API integrations (Phase 3).
