## 2. Industry Pricing Models

### Primary Model: Sheet Size Pricing

The overwhelming industry standard is **per-sheet pricing by length** at a standard 22" width. This simplifies quoting and maximizes profitability when sheets are well-optimized.

#### Standard 22" Width Gang Sheet Pricing (Industry Averages)

| Size     | Industry Range | 4Ink Current | Assessment       |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 22"x12"  | $4–$8          | —            | —                |
| 22"x24"  | $8–$20         | **$18**      | Mid-range retail |
| 22"x48"  | $16–$30        | **$27**      | Competitive      |
| 22"x76"  | $25–$45        | **$42**      | Strong value     |
| 22"x100" | $35–$60        | **$57**      | Market rate      |
| 22"x136" | ~$45–$75       | **$77**      | Slightly premium |
| 22"x164" | ~$55–$90       | **$92**      | Competitive      |
| 22"x194" | ~$65–$105      | **$110**     | Slightly premium |
| 22"x219" | ~$75–$120      | **$124**     | Market rate      |
| 22"x240" | $80–$110       | **$138**     | Premium pricing  |

### Alternative Model: Per-Inch Linear Pricing

Some providers charge by linear inch at 22" width:

- **Wholesale**: $0.29–$0.40 per inch
- **Retail**: $0.50–$0.75 per inch
- **Small orders (<24")**: Setup fee + higher per-inch rate

### Hybrid Model: Per-Piece Tiered Pricing

For individual transfer pricing (not gang sheets):

| Transfer Size   | 1–14 pcs | 15–49 pcs | 50–99 pcs | 100–249 pcs | 250+ pcs |
| --------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 2"x2" (small)   | $2.00    | $1.20     | $0.90     | $0.80       | $0.70    |
| 5"x5" (medium)  | $4.00    | $2.40     | $1.80     | $1.60       | $1.40    |
| 11"x11" (large) | $10.00   | $6.00     | $4.50     | $4.00       | $3.50    |
