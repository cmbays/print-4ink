## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes findings from four parallel research streams to define Screen Print Pro's Price Matrix vertical — the pricing engine that powers automated quoting for 4Ink's screen printing shop.

**The Opportunity**: 4Ink currently uses The Print Life, which scores 74% (26/35) in our competitive analysis. It excels at automation and simplicity but is weak on flexibility (2/5) and customization. The top competitors (YoPrint, Teesom, PriceIt) also score 74% — meaning **no one in the market has pulled away**. Screen Print Pro can leapfrog every competitor by combining PrintLife's automation strength with the flexibility of Teesom, the innovation of YoPrint, and a 10x better UX than anything on the market.

**The Strategy**: Build a centralized pricing engine (not just a lookup table) that all verticals consume as a service. Wrap it in a "Simple Mode" wizard for 5-minute setup and a "Power Mode" spreadsheet grid for advanced users. Show real-time margin visibility in every price cell. This gives 4Ink something no competitor offers: **instant profitability clarity with zero friction**.

## 1. Industry Landscape

### How Screen Printing Pricing Works

Screen printing pricing is a **multi-dimensional matrix** where the per-piece price is a function of:

```
Price Per Piece = (Garment Cost × Markup) + (Setup Fees ÷ Quantity) + (Colors × Locations × Per-Hit Rate) + Surcharges
```

**Primary pricing dimensions** (in order of impact):

1. **Quantity** — The biggest lever. Price drops 10–25% per tier as setup costs amortize. Standard tiers: 12, 24, 48, 72, 144+.
2. **Color Count** — Each color = one screen = $15–35 setup + $0.50–1.00 per hit. Most jobs are 1–4 colors.
3. **Print Locations** — Front (base), back (+$2/piece), sleeves (+$3 each). Each location is a separate press pass.
4. **Garment Type** — T-shirts ($2–5 wholesale, 150–200% markup), hoodies ($12–25, 100–150% markup).

**Secondary pricing dimensions**:

5. **Setup Fees** — $15–35/screen, waived on reorders (3–12 months) or large orders (72+).
6. **Specialty Inks** — Water-based (+$0.50), discharge (+$0.75), metallic (+$1.00), glow (+$1.50).
7. **Rush Orders** — +10% (5–7 days), +25% (3–4 days), +50–100% (24–48 hours).
8. **Artwork Fees** — $0 camera-ready, $25–40 simple, $40–65/hr custom.

### Contract vs. Retail Pricing

| Dimension       | Retail                     | Contract                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Target customer | End consumer, small orders | B2B, repeat/bulk         |
| Per-piece price | Higher ($12–15 for 24 pcs) | Lower ($5–7 for 72+ pcs) |
| Markup          | 150–200%                   | 100–150%                 |
| Margin target   | 50–100%                    | 15–25%                   |
| Setup fees      | Charged                    | Often waived             |
| Artwork         | Often included             | Customer provides        |
| MOQ             | 12–24 pieces               | 24–72 pieces             |

**Contract standard rates** (ICS Inks, Threadbird): $0.50/print, $20/color screen setup, $5 color change, $15 basic artwork.

### Critical Industry Insight

> "Pricing is very difficult, accounting for overhead, time on press, colors, t-shirt costs." — T-Shirt Forums

The #1 pain point across all forums and reviews is **pricing complexity**. Shopvox users "don't understand pricing after 3 years." This is our opportunity: make pricing obvious in 5 minutes.

| Simplicity        | **5/5** | Core strength. Prevents overwhelm.                                                    |
| Integration       | 4/5     | All-in-one: quoting → production → client communication.                              |
| Automation        | **5/5** | Prevents common errors (forgetting ink charges, setup fees).                          |

**PrintLife's DNA**: Optimized for "set it and forget it" — maximum automation, minimum flexibility. Great for shops that fit the mold, frustrating for shops with edge cases.

**What 4Ink gets today**: Excellent error prevention, simple setup, good quoting-to-production flow.
**What 4Ink is missing**: Custom pricing rules, flexible matrix structures, margin visibility, what-if scenarios, modern UX.

## 3. Integration Architecture

### Price Matrix as a Centralized Service

Industry leaders (Printavo, YoPrint, InfoFlo, Ordant) treat pricing as a **centralized calculation engine** consumed by all verticals — not a lookup table embedded in the quote form.

```
                      ┌─────────────────┐
                      │  Price Matrix   │
                      │   (Engine)      │
                      └────────┬────────┘

                      └─────────────────┘
```

### Five Integration Points

**1. Customer Vertical** — Price matrix consumes customer context:

- Contract pricing (customer-specific price sheets, negotiated rates)
- Loyalty tiers (standard → silver → gold → platinum based on lifetime volume)
- Manual discount authority (max % per role, approval workflow above threshold)
- Customer groups with shared pricing rules

**2. Quoting Vertical** — Primary consumer of price matrix:

- Auto-calculated quotes pull base pricing + customer modifiers
- Quote-specific overrides (line-item exceptions, manual adjustments)
- Quote versioning when price sheets change mid-negotiation
- Margin visibility: show cost, price, and margin % to internal users
- Price locking on approval (honored even if matrix changes)
- Quote expiration (typically 30 days)

**3. Invoicing Vertical** — Converts quotes to billable documents:

- Price locking: invoices honor quoted prices, not current matrix
- Progress billing: 50% deposit typical, then balance on delivery
- Tax calculation integration
- Discount audit trail (type, amount, reason, approver)
- Payment tracking (partial, full, overdue)

**4. Reporting Vertical** — Consumes all pricing data:

- Margin by job (quoted vs. actual)
- Margin by customer (lifetime, per-period)
- Margin by product type (t-shirts, hoodies, hats)
- Pricing trends (revenue, margin, job count over time)
- Discount impact analysis (erosion tracking)

**5. Production Vertical** — Actual vs. estimated costs:

- Cost targets from quote (estimated labor, ink, setup)
- Actual cost tracking during production (time entries, material usage)
- Variance analysis (flag jobs exceeding estimates by >10%)
- Realized margin (what we actually made vs. what we quoted)
- Feed variance data back to calibrate price matrix

### Data Flow

```
Customer Context → Price Matrix Engine → Quote (with margin visibility)
    → Price Lock on Approval → Invoice (honors locked prices)
        → Production (tracks actual costs) → Reporting (margin analysis)
            → Feed back to Price Matrix calibration
```

## 4. UX Strategy: 10x Better Than PrintLife

### Core UX Thesis

> **PrintLife optimizes for automation at the expense of visibility. We optimize for both.**

PrintLife prevents mistakes (good) but doesn't show profitability (bad). Screen Print Pro will auto-calculate AND show real-time margins in every price cell — so the shop owner always knows exactly how much money they're making.

### Three UX Pillars

**Pillar 1: Simplicity** (match PrintLife's 5/5, extend it)

- Wizard-style setup: new price matrix in 5 minutes
- Smart defaults: pre-fill with industry averages ($60/hr, 2x markup, standard tiers)
- Progressive disclosure: Simple Mode default, Power Mode for advanced users

**Pillar 2: Transparency** (PrintLife's blind spot)

- Real-time margin % per price cell (green/yellow/red indicators)
- Price breakdown: garment cost + setup allocation + print fees = total
- Profitability dashboard: "87% of your prices are profitable"
- What-if scenarios: "What if I raise prices 10%?"

**Pillar 3: Flexibility** (PrintLife's 2/5 → our 5/5)

- Unlimited price matrices (no artificial limits, à la Teesom)
- Custom pricing rules and exceptions
- Multiple pricing modes (tiered, breakless, area-based)
- CSV import/export for bulk editing
- Version history with rollback

### Progressive Disclosure Model

**Simple Mode (Default — the "5-minute setup")**:

1. Enter shop basics (base hourly rate, overhead %)
2. Choose structure: Simple (qty tiers) or Advanced (qty + colors + locations)
3. Set quantity breakpoints (pre-filled: 12, 24, 48, 72, 144+)
4. Auto-calculate prices from smart defaults, allow tweaks
5. Preview with sample orders, see margins
6. Save & Apply

**Power Mode (toggle — "the spreadsheet")**:

- TanStack Table with inline editing
- All columns visible (quantity, colors, locations, garment, setup, surcharges)
- Bulk edit cells, fill handle for dragging values
- Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, Ctrl+C/V, Enter to edit)
- CSV import/export with column mapping wizard
- Version history with audit trail

### Visual Margin Indicators (Niji Palette)

Every price cell gets a subtle color indicator:

| Margin | Color  | Token                       | Meaning             |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ≥ 30%  | Green  | `--color-success` (#54ca74) | Healthy profit      |
| 15–30% | Yellow | `--color-warning` (#ffc663) | Low profit, caution |
| < 15%  | Red    | `--color-error` (#d23e08)   | Unprofitable        |

Implementation: small colored dot or left border on price cell (Linear Calm base, Neobrutalist accent). Tooltip on hover shows breakdown: "Margin: 32% ($450 revenue - $306 cost = $144 profit)".

### Design System Mapping

| Layer                    | Application                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Linear Calm**          | Monochrome grid, opacity-based text hierarchy, generous whitespace, subtle borders         |
| **Raycast Polish**       | Glass effect on matrix card, smooth cell transitions, responsive hover states              |
| **Neobrutalist Delight** | Bold "Save Pricing" button with 4px shadow, vibrant margin colors, springy save animations |

## 7. Technical Recommendations

### Architecture

- **Price Matrix as a Service**: Separate calculation engine module, not embedded in UI
- **Zod-first schemas**: All pricing data structures defined as Zod schemas (project standard)
- **URL state for filters**: Pricing view filters/search live in URL params (project standard)
- **TanStack Table**: Power Mode grid built on existing tech stack dependency
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Simple Mode wizard validation

### Key Schemas Needed

```
lib/schemas/
  price-matrix.ts        # Core: PriceSheet, PriceTier, PricingRule
  customer-pricing.ts    # Contract: CustomerPriceSheet, CustomerTier
  quote-pricing.ts       # Extension: QuoteLineItem pricing fields
  invoice.ts             # New vertical: Invoice, InvoiceLineItem, Payment
  job-costing.ts         # Extension: JobCosting, ProductionTimeEntry
  reporting.ts           # New vertical: MarginReport, CustomerMargin
```

### Mock Data Requirements

Phase 1 needs realistic mock data for:

- 3–5 price matrices (Standard, Contract, Seasonal, Rush, Premium)
- 8–12 garment types with realistic wholesale costs
- 5–7 quantity break tiers per matrix
- 1–6 color pricing per tier
- Standard print locations with upcharges
- Sample quotes using the price matrix

6. Quote integration (matrix feeds quote calculator)

### Phase 1b: Demo Wow Features (P1 highlights)

7. Real-time margin indicators (green/yellow/red)
8. What-if scenarios
9. Power Mode grid (TanStack Table inline editing)
10. Contract vs. retail toggle
11. Size matrix entry

### Phase 2: Full P1 + P2 Start

12. CSV import/export
13. Customer-specific pricing
14. Version history
15. Breakless pricing option
16. Profitability dashboard

## 9. Risk Assessment

| Risk                        | Impact                                 | Mitigation                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-engineering the matrix | Delays demo, adds complexity           | Start with Simple Mode wizard only. Power Mode is P1.                                  |
| Pricing formula errors      | Wrong quotes, lost money               | Comprehensive unit tests for calculation engine. Test against known PrintLife outputs. |
| Integration complexity      | Price matrix → Quote → Invoice cascade | Build as service with clean API boundaries. Test integration points independently.     |
| UX complexity               | Users overwhelmed by pricing options   | Progressive disclosure. Simple Mode hides 80% of options.                              |
| Mock data unrealism         | 4Ink finds demo unconvincing           | Use real industry rates from research. Match 4Ink's actual garment types/costs.        |

---

## 10. Success Criteria for Demo

The price matrix demo should make 4Ink say: **"This is so much better than PrintLife."**

### Must Demonstrate

1. **5-minute setup**: Create a new price matrix from scratch using the wizard
2. **Instant margins**: Show green/yellow/red margin indicators per price cell
3. **What-if power**: "What if I raise prices 10%?" with side-by-side comparison
4. **Quote flow**: Create a quote that auto-pulls from the price matrix
5. **Contract pricing**: Show different prices for a contract customer vs. retail
6. **Price breakdown**: Transparent garment + setup + print = total breakdown

### Should Demonstrate

7. **Power Mode**: Toggle to spreadsheet grid, edit cells inline
8. **Size matrix**: Enter S:10, M:25, L:15 in one line
9. **Rush pricing**: Toggle rush order, see price adjust
10. **Margin alerts**: Show a below-threshold quote flagged for review
