## Next Steps for Research Team

1. **Task #3** (price-matrix-integrator): Map how pricing connects to other verticals (quotes, artwork, production, shipping)
2. **Task #4** (ux-researcher): Analyze UX/UI patterns from top performers (The Print Life, Teesom, YoPrint)
3. **Task #5** (synthesizer): Combine all research into final recommendations with P0/P1/P2 prioritization

**Blocks Resolved**: Task #5 can now proceed with competitor data.
