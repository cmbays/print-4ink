## 1. Standard Pricing Dimensions

### 1.1 Quantity Breaks (Primary Driver)

**Industry Standard Tiers:**

The most common quantity break structure follows wholesale garment ordering patterns (multiples of 12):

| Tier | Quantity Range | Use Case |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | 12-23 | Minimum viable order |
| 2 | 24-35 | Small team/event |
| 3 | 36-47 | Mid-size order |
| 4 | 48-71 | Standard bulk order |
| 5 | 72-143 | Large order (setup fee often waived) |
| 6 | 144-199 | Volume order |
| 7 | 200-299 | High-volume customer |
| 8 | 300+ | Contract/wholesale pricing |

**Why These Numbers?**

- Mirrors **wholesale garment ordering** patterns (sold by the dozen)
- Aligns with **press efficiency** (most shops optimize around 24-72 piece runs)
- **Setup cost amortization** — larger orders dilute per-piece setup costs

**Practitioner Insights (T-Shirt Forums):**

- Average minimums: 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 64, 72 (most efficient shops)
- Price drops dramatically: "$8 per shirt at 12 qty, $4 at 144 qty, $3 at 288 qty"
- Minimum order typically 12–24 pieces (24 most common)

### 1.2 Color Count (Second Most Critical)

**Pricing Model:**

Each color requires a separate screen, impacting both **setup costs** and **per-piece print costs**.

**Typical Structure:**
- **1 color:** Base price
- **2 colors:** +$0.50 to +$1.00 per garment
- **3 colors:** +$1.00 to +$2.00 per garment
- **4+ colors:** +$0.50 per additional color, OR flat upcharge (e.g., +$100 per color beyond 4)

**Per-Color Hit Pricing:**
- **$0.55 per color hit** (common practitioner rate)
- Example: 2-color back print = $1.10 per shirt

**Setup Impact:**
- Each color = 1 screen = $15–$35 setup fee
- Multi-color jobs require precise **registration** (alignment), adding labor

### 1.3 Print Locations

**Standard Locations & Pricing:**

| Location | Typical Upcharge | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **Front chest** | Base price | Default location |
| **Full front** | Base price | Same setup as chest |
| **Back** | +$2.00 per piece | Requires second press pass |
| **Left sleeve** | +$3.00 per piece | Typically 1-color only |
| **Right sleeve** | +$3.00 per piece | Small print area, fiddly setup |
| **Pocket** | +$5.00+ per piece | Complex positioning |
| **Pant leg** | +$5.00+ per piece | Specialty setup required |

**Multi-Location Rules:**
- **Back + sleeve:** Double the cost
- **Back + both sleeves:** Triple the cost
- **Setup fees per location:** $30 per location (often waived at 36+ pieces)

**Practitioner Consensus:**
- Front print is always included in base price
- Back print adds ~50% of original print fee
- Sleeves limited to 1 color (print area too small)

### 1.4 Garment Types

**Cost Hierarchy:**

| Garment Type | Wholesale Cost | Markup | Retail Price |
|--------------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| **Cotton T-shirt** | $2–$5 | 150–200% | $5.50–$9 |
| **Performance/Poly tee** | $5–$8 | 150–200% | $10–$15 |
| **Long-sleeve tee** | $6–$10 | 150–200% | $12–$18 |
| **Hoodie/Sweatshirt** | $12–$25 | 100–150% | $18–$35 |
| **Polo shirt** | $10–$15 | 150–200% | $20–$30 |

**Why Garment Type Matters:**
- **Blank garment cost** is the largest variable for high-end garments
- Hoodies cost more due to **thicker fabric** (more ink absorption) and **larger print area**
- Specialty fabrics (tri-blend, ring-spun) command premium pricing

**Industry Markup Standards:**
- **150–200% markup** on t-shirts (most common)
- **100–150% markup** on hoodies/sweatshirts
- **50% markup** on contract/wholesale orders

## 3. Common Pricing Models

### 3.1 Per-Piece Tiered Pricing (Most Common)

**Structure:**

```
Base Formula = (Garment Cost × Markup) + (Setup Fees ÷ Quantity) + Print Fees

Print Fees = (Colors × Locations × Per-Hit Rate)
```

**Example Calculation:**

**Job:** 50 white t-shirts, 2-color front, 1-color back

| Component | Calculation | Cost |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Garment | $3 blank × 200% markup | $6.00 |
| Setup fees | 3 screens × $20 ÷ 50 qty | $1.20 |
| Front print | 2 colors × $0.55/hit | $1.10 |
| Back print | 1 color × $0.55/hit + $2 location fee | $2.55 |
| **Total per piece** | | **$10.85** |

**Quantity Break Impact:**

| Quantity | Per-Piece Price | Total Order |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 12 | $16.00 | $192 |
| 24 | $13.00 | $312 |
| 48 | $11.00 | $528 |
| 72 | $9.50 | $684 |
| 144 | $8.00 | $1,152 |

- [DecoNetwork: Screen Printing Pricing Strategies](https://www.deconetwork.com/screen-printing-pricing-strategies-a-practical-guide-deconetwork/)

### 3.2 Cost-Plus Pricing

**Formula:**

```
Price = Total Costs × (1 + Markup Percentage)

Total Costs = Materials + Labor + Overhead + Setup
```

**Typical Markups:**
- **30–50% margin** (industry standard)
- **20% minimum** recommended for sustainability
- Contract printing: 15–25% (higher volume, lower margin)

**Advantages:**
- Ensures consistent profitability
- Scales with cost increases (ink, garments, labor)
- Simple to explain to customers

**Sources:**
- [Printavo: Screen Printing Pricing Guide](https://www.printavo.com/blog/screen-printing-pricing/)
- [Teesom: Pricing Your Way to Profitability](https://teesom.com/pricing-your-way-to-profitability/)

### 3.3 Flat-Rate Components

**When Used:**
- **Small order minimums:** "12-piece minimum at $150 flat"
- **Setup-heavy jobs:** "Complex multi-location = $500 flat + $5/piece"
- **Sample orders:** "Samples: $75 flat (up to 3 pieces)"

**Common Flat Fees:**
- Screen setup: $20–$35 per screen (flat, regardless of quantity)
- Artwork: $25–$65 (flat, regardless of complexity)
- Rush orders: Flat % upcharge (see Section 6.2)

---

## 4. Contract vs. Retail Pricing

### 4.1 Retail Pricing (Direct to End Customer)

**Characteristics:**
- **Higher per-piece prices** (lower volume, more hand-holding)
- Full setup fees charged
- Includes customer service overhead
- Markup: 150–200% on garments

**Typical Minimums:**
- 12–24 pieces
- Often includes design services

**Example Retail Price:**
- 24 shirts, 1-color front: **$12–$15 per shirt**

**Sources:**
- [Printavo: Retail vs. Contract Screen Printing](https://www.printavo.com/blog/retail-vs-contract-screen-printing-what-is-contract-printing/)

### 4.2 Contract Pricing (B2B/Trade)

**Characteristics:**
- **Lower per-piece prices** (higher volume, repeat customers)
- Setup fees often waived (minimum 72+ pieces)
- Assumes customer provides print-ready art
- Markup: 100–150% (or 15–25% margin)

**Typical Minimums:**
- 24–72 pieces (often higher)
- Recurring orders expected

**Example Contract Price:**
- 72+ shirts, 1-color front: **$5–$7 per shirt**

**Practitioner Insights:**
- "$2.50 per print, minimum 12 garments (24 for 2-color)"
- "Free screens for 72+ pieces, $15/screen under 72"

## 5. Volume Discount Structures

### 5.1 How Volume Discounts Work

**Price Inversion:**

Screen printing exhibits **inverse pricing** — per-piece cost **decreases** as quantity **increases**, because:

1. **Fixed setup costs** amortize over more units
2. **Press efficiency** improves (longer runs = less downtime)
3. **Garment wholesale pricing** offers bulk discounts

**Typical Per-Piece Price Drop:**

| Quantity | Price Drop from Previous Tier |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| 12 → 24 | -15% to -20% |
| 24 → 48 | -10% to -15% |
| 48 → 72 | -5% to -10% |
| 72 → 144 | -10% to -15% (setup fees waived) |
| 144+ | -5% to -10% per tier |

**Real Example (from forum):**
- 12 shirts: **$8.00 each**
- 24 shirts: **$7.00 each** (-12.5%)
- 48 shirts: **$6.00 each** (-14.3%)
- 72 shirts: **$5.00 each** (-16.7%)
- 144 shirts: **$4.00 each** (-20%)
- 288 shirts: **$3.00 each** (-25%)

**Sources:**

- [T-Shirt Forums: Pricing Structure Discussion](https://www.t-shirtforums.com/threads/screen-printing-price-breaks.341817/)

### 5.2 Quantity Break Automation Features

**Table Stakes for Price Matrix Software:**

1. **Auto-calculate breaks** based on setup cost recovery
2. **Visual price curves** showing savings per tier
3. **"Best value" highlighting** (e.g., "Save $50 by ordering 48 instead of 36")
4. **Custom tier configuration** (shops set their own break points)
5. **Margin protection** (never price below minimum margin)

**Advanced Features:**

- **Dynamic breaks** based on current garment inventory
- **Rush order tier adjustments** (fewer breaks, higher minimums)
- **Customer-specific volume discounts** (contract customers get steeper curves)

## 6. Industry-Specific Considerations

### 6.1 Specialty Inks & Upcharges

**Ink Types & Pricing:**

| Ink Type | Base Upcharge | Use Case |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Plastisol** (standard) | Included | Default, most durable |
| **Water-based** | +$0.50/print | Soft hand, light garments |
| **Discharge** | +$0.75/print | Removes dye, prints on dark fabrics |
| **Metallic/Shimmer** | +$1.00/print | Specialty finish |
| **Glow-in-the-dark** | +$1.50/print | Novelty prints |
| **Puff ink** | +$1.00/print | 3D raised effect |

**Discharge Ink Specifics:**
- Requires **two-part system** (ink + activator, 9:1 ratio)
- Only works on **100% cotton** (removes fabric dye)
- Heat curing required (300°F)
- Soft hand, breathable finish

**Sources:**
- [Raygun Printing: Specialty Ink Pricing](https://www.raygunprinting.com/price-guide)
- [Sabio Printing: Water-Based & Discharge](https://sabioprinting.com/what-is-water-based-and-discharge-printing/)

### 6.2 Rush Orders & Turnaround Time

**Standard Turnaround:**
- **7–10 business days** (most common)
- **10–14 business days** (conservative shops)

**Rush Fee Structures:**

| Turnaround | Upcharge | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **5–7 days** | +10% to +25% | Requires schedule rearrangement |
| **3–4 days** | +25% to +50% | Bumps other jobs |
| **24–48 hours** | +50% to +100% | Emergency only, limited styles |

**Rush Order Constraints:**
- Limited garment styles/colors available
- Minimum quantities may increase
- Artwork must be 100% camera-ready
- No revisions allowed

**Real-World Examples:**
- "Rush service 5–7 days +10%, Extra Rush 3–5 days +25%"
- "25% for 4–5 day, 50% for 3 day, 100% for 24–48 hour"

- [Central Screen Printing: Turnaround & Rush Service](https://www.centralscreenprinting.com/page/turnaround-and-rush-service)

### 6.3 Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ)

**Industry Standard MOQs:**

- **24 pieces** (most common)
- **12 pieces** (budget shops, higher per-piece price)
- **36 pieces** (premium shops, better margins)

**Why MOQs Exist:**

Setup costs don't change whether printing 1 shirt or 100:
- Screen burning: ~15 minutes per screen
- Press setup: ~30 minutes (screen loading, ink mixing, registration)
- Cleanup: ~15 minutes

**Total Setup Time:** 1–2 hours per job, regardless of quantity

**MOQ Calculation:**

```
MOQ = (Desired Hourly Rate × Setup Hours) ÷ (Target Profit Per Piece)

Example: ($50/hour × 1.5 hours) ÷ $5 profit = 15 pieces minimum
```

**Small Order Alternatives:**

- **DTG (Direct-to-Garment):** No setup fees, economical for 1–12 pieces
- **Heat transfers:** Pre-made transfers, lower MOQ (1–6 pieces)
- **DTF (Direct-to-Film):** Hybrid method, good for 6–24 pieces

## 8. How Pricing Data Is Organized & Maintained

### 8.1 Common Data Structures

**Pricing Matrix Formats:**

1. **Spreadsheet-Based (Excel/Google Sheets)**
   - Most common among small shops
   - Rows = Quantity breaks, Columns = Color counts
   - Separate sheets per garment type
   - Formula-driven, easy to adjust

2. **Database-Driven (Software)**
   - Separate tables for: Garments, Setup Fees, Print Fees, Breaks
   - Relational model allows complex rules
   - Version control for price changes

**Example Matrix Structure:**

```
Garment: Gildan 5000 (White Cotton Tee)
Base Cost: $3.00
Markup: 200%

| Quantity | 1-Color | 2-Color | 3-Color | 4-Color |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

## 10. Key Insights & Recommendations

### 10.1 Critical Success Factors

**What Makes a Price Matrix Software Successful:**

1. **Accuracy > Speed**
   - Shops prioritize correct pricing over fast quoting
   - Underpricing = lost profit, Overpricing = lost jobs
   - "Keep very detailed notes on everything" (practitioner advice)

2. **Flexibility Matters**
   - Every shop has unique cost structures
   - No "one size fits all" pricing
   - Custom breaks, custom markups, custom rules

3. **Transparency Builds Trust**
   - Show breakdown (garment + setup + print = total)
   - Explain why setup fees exist
   - Educate customers on quantity break savings

4. **Margin Protection**
   - Never let users quote below cost
   - Flag low-margin jobs automatically
   - Track actual costs (not just estimates)

### 10.2 Common Pitfalls (From Forums)

**What Shop Owners Struggle With:**

1. **Underestimating True Costs**
   - Forgetting overhead (rent, utilities, waste)
   - Not tracking ink usage accurately
   - Ignoring labor for setup/cleanup

2. **Inconsistent Pricing**
   - Different prices for same job (customer confusion)
   - No version control on pricing changes
   - Verbal quotes vs. written quotes mismatch

3. **Over-Complicating Matrices**
   - Too many variables = decision paralysis
   - Start simple (quantity + colors only), add complexity later

4. **Ignoring Competitors**
   - Pricing in a vacuum leads to losing bids
   - Regional pricing varies wildly

## 12. Conclusion

Screen printing price matrix software must balance **simplicity** (easy for customers to understand) with **complexity** (accurate cost modeling for shop profitability). The industry has converged on a **tiered quantity break model** with **per-color and per-location upcharges**, anchored by **setup fees** that amortize over larger orders.

**Key Takeaway:** Successful pricing matrices are **dynamic** (adjust for volume, garment type, complexity) yet **transparent** (customers understand why prices change). The software should **protect margins** while **staying competitive**, and must be **flexible** enough to accommodate each shop's unique cost structure.
