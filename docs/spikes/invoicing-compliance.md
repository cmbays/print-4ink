## Screen Printing Tax Treatment by State

**Key finding**: Screen printing is classified as **fabrication of tangible personal property** in virtually all states. The entire charge (materials + labor + setup + design) is taxable.

| State | Rate (State) | Treatment | Key Rules |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Indiana** | 7% | Taxable | 4Ink's home state. Full fabrication charge taxable. |
| **Kentucky** | 6% | Taxable | Close market (Louisville). Full charge taxable. |
| California | 7.25% + local | Fabrication | Setup/rush fees included in taxable amount |
| Texas | 6.25% + local | Fabrication | Total price including all expenses |
| Florida | 6% + local | Fully taxable | All charges even when separately stated |
| New York | 4% + local | Fabrication | Section 1105(c)(2) |
| Ohio | 5.75% + local | Taxable | Services to tangible personal property |
| North Carolina | 4.75% + local | Fully taxable | Creative design included in taxable sales price |

**Critical**: Separately stating labor does NOT make it exempt in CA, FL, NC, or most states.

**Only common exemptions:**
- Valid resale certificate (customer reselling goods)
- Qualifying tax-exempt nonprofit
- Equipment purchases by the printer (manufacturer's exemption)

---

## Required Invoice Elements (US)

### Required
- Seller's legal business name and DBA
- Seller's business address
- Buyer's name and address
- Unique sequential invoice number
- Invoice date and due date
- Itemized description of goods/services (quantities, unit prices)
- Total amount due
- Sales tax (separately stated)
- Tax identification number (EIN/TIN) for 1099 thresholds

### Recommended
- Purchase order number (if customer provides one)
- Payment methods accepted
- Late payment penalties/interest rates
- Remittance address (if different from business)
- Payment terms

---

## Tax-Exempt Customers

### Resale Certificate Workflow
1. **Collect** — Customer provides state-issued resale certificate before first tax-exempt purchase
2. **Verify** — Confirm permit number is active, not expired, business name matches
3. **Store** — Keep copies (your proof during audit)
4. **Flag** — Mark customer as tax-exempt in system
5. **Monitor** — Track expiry dates, request renewals

### Multi-Jurisdiction Certificates
- **MTC Uniform Certificate**: Valid in ~38 states
- **Streamlined Sales Tax Certificate**: Valid in 24 member states
- Some states require renewal (PA, FL every 5 years; TX is one-time)

---

## Multi-State Tax (Nexus)

Since *South Dakota v. Wayfair* (2018), every sales-tax state has economic nexus rules:

| Common Threshold | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|
| $100,000 revenue | Most common |
| 200 transactions | Being eliminated by many states |
| $500,000 revenue | NY, CA, TX |

**4Ink relevance**: Mostly IN/KY local market. Economic nexus unlikely unless shipping volume grows significantly. Tax rate per invoice (not hardcoded) provides flexibility.

### Tax Service Integration (Phase 2+)

| Service | Cost | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| TaxJar | $19-$99/mo | Simple, cheaper. Owned by Stripe. |
| Avalara | ~$5,000/yr | Complex multi-state. More robust. |

---

## Record Retention Requirements

| Authority | Period | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| IRS (standard) | 3 years | Income/expense records |
| IRS (bad debt) | 7 years | Bad debt deductions |
| IRS (underreported) | 6 years | Income underreported by >25% |
| IRS (fraud/no filing) | Indefinite | |
| IRS (employment) | 4 years | |
| Most states | 3-4 years | Varies |

**Recommendation**: Design for **7-year retention**. Never hard-delete invoice records.

---

## Data Integrity Requirements

### Invoice Immutability
- Once issued, invoices must never be modified or deleted
- Corrections: issue credit memo + new invoice
- Voiding: mark as VOID, keep record
- Draft invoices: can be freely edited before issuance

### Sequential Numbering
- Each invoice must have a unique number
- Numbers must progress chronologically
- Gaps acceptable (voided invoices) but documented
- Voided numbers never reused

### Audit Trail
Every invoice action logged:
- **Who**: User performing the action
- **What**: Action type (created, sent, voided, payment received, etc.)
- **When**: UTC timestamp
- **Details**: Before/after values for changes
- Logs are append-only, never editable

### Data Export Requirements
Support exporting to:
- **PDF**: Individual invoices
- **CSV/Excel**: Bulk export for accountants
- **JSON**: System integrations and data migration

---

## Accounting Integration

### QuickBooks Online (Primary Target)

| Entity | Direction | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Customers | Bidirectional | Name, email, address, tax-exempt |
| Items/Products | App → QBO | Line items, SKUs, descriptions |
| Invoices | App → QBO | Line items, tax, totals, due dates |
| Payments | App → QBO | Method, amount, applied to invoice |
| Tax Rates | QBO → App | Pull configured rates |
| Credit Memos | App → QBO | Refunds and adjustments |

**Technical**: OAuth 2.0, SyncToken for updates, 500 queries/min, 500K API calls/month

### QuickBooks Desktop (Secondary)
- Still $2.78B in ecosystem revenue
- Integration via QBXML Web Connector (SOAP-based polling)
- Consider middleware like Conductor (REST API over Web Connector)
- Phase 3 if customer demand warrants

### Common Integration Pitfalls
1. **Duplicate entries** — biggest risk. Use idempotency keys.
2. **Sync timing** — bank feeds vs app syncs create mismatches
3. **Tax rounding** — match QBO's rounding method
4. **Deleted records** — always void, never delete (prevents orphans)
5. **Chart of accounts changes** — validate mappings on each sync
6. **Token expiration** — handle OAuth refresh gracefully

---

## Payment Processing Compliance

### PCI DSS
- 4Ink is Level 4 (<20K e-commerce or <1M total transactions)
- **Best approach**: Never store card numbers. Use tokenized processor (Square).
- With tokenization: SAQ-A (simplest compliance questionnaire)

### ACH Requirements (if offered)
- Written authorization required for all ACH debits
- Customer notified in advance of amounts/dates
- Banking info encrypted at rest and in transit
- Authorization records retained up to 7 years

### Credit Card Surcharges

| State | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Indiana | Allowed (up to actual processing cost) |
| Kentucky | Allowed |
| California | **Prohibited** |
| Connecticut | **Prohibited** |
| Massachusetts | **Prohibited** |
| Debit/prepaid cards | **Prohibited everywhere** (federal law) |

**Recommendation**: Offer cash discounts instead of surcharges (legal everywhere).

## Financial Best Practices

### AR Aging Buckets

| Bucket | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Current | Not yet due | No action |
| 1-30 days | Slightly past due | Automated reminder |
| 31-60 days | Past due | Follow-up call/email |
| 61-90 days | Seriously past due | Hold new orders |
| 90+ days | Delinquent | Final demand, consider write-off |

**Healthy benchmark**: 80-90% of receivables in Current/1-30

### Bad Debt Handling
- Deductible under IRS Section 166
- Must demonstrate reasonable collection efforts
- Document: debt evidence, collection attempts, determination of worthlessness
- Keep records 7 years for bad debt deductions
- System: mark as "written off" with date/reason, never delete

### Late Fees
- Industry standard: 1.5%/month (18% annually) on past-due balances
- 4Ink decision: configurable per customer, auto-calculated, separate line item
- Must be disclosed in payment terms on invoice

### Revenue Recognition (GAAP ASC 606)
- Deposits are NOT revenue when received (liability: deferred revenue)
- Revenue recognized when goods delivered/services rendered
- Small businesses on cash basis have simpler treatment
- Track deposits separately from recognized revenue
