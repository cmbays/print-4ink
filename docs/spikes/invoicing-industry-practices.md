## The 8-Step Quote-to-Cash Pipeline

1. **Estimate/Quote Creation** — Shop receives request, enters garment details, quantities, colors, print locations, generates quote
2. **Quote Approval** — Customer reviews/approves via email link, portal, or verbal confirmation
3. **Deposit Collection** — Before ordering blanks or burning screens. Industry standard: 50% (ranges 40-100% depending on relationship)
4. **Work Order Generation** — Approved quote converts to internal work order with artwork, color references, print specs, garment details
5. **Production** — Screen burning, press setup, printing, finishing. Changes tracked (overruns, shortages, color changes)
6. **Invoice Generation** — Two approaches: all-at-once (wait until complete) or progressive (per line item as completed)
7. **Balance Collection** — Deposit subtracted from final total. Remaining balance before pickup/shipment
8. **Delivery & Close** — Ship or pickup. Best practice: trigger invoice automatically when shipping scan occurs

### Key Insights

- Net 30 NOT recommended for new/small shops — you front all material costs
- Credit applications required before extending Net terms
- Late payment penalties of 1.5%/month (18% annually) are standard
- 87% of businesses report invoices are paid after the due date

## Payment Methods

| Method             | Pros                              | Cons                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Credit/Debit Card  | Immediate, traceable              | 2.5-3.5% processing fees |
| Square             | Payment links, QR codes, terminal | Processing fees          |
| Stripe             | Built into most software          | Processing fees          |
| PayPal/Venmo/Zelle | Familiar to customers             | Harder to track          |
| Check              | No processing fees                | Slow, can bounce         |
| Cash               | No fees, immediate                | No paper trail           |
| ACH/Bank Transfer  | Lower fees than cards             | Slower processing        |

## Recurring & Repeat Customers

- **Screen storage**: 3-12 months (waive setup fees on reorders within window)
- **Artwork files**: Saved and linked to customer record
- **Quote duplication**: Use previous quotes as starting points
- **Contract pricing tiers**: Standard, preferred, contract, wholesale
- **Blanket POs**: Master agreement for recurring purchases at pre-negotiated prices

## Itemization: Two Schools of Thought

**Full Itemization**: Break out every component as separate line items. Helps track costs, common on final invoices.

**Bundled Pricing**: One total price per line with description. Rationale: "detailed itemization makes customers try to negotiate." More common on quotes.

**4Ink Decision**: Configurable per invoice — toggle between itemized and bundled views.

## Spoilage Standards

| Scenario                            | Acceptable Rate                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Standard items, standard decoration | 2%                                  |
| Jobs of 100+ pieces                 | Up to 3%                            |
| Jobs under 100 pieces               | Up to 10%                           |
| Internal target for quality shops   | Under 2%                            |
| Minimum spoilage                    | 1 piece OR 1.5% (whichever greater) |

## Credit Memo Triggers

1. **Shortages/under-runs** beyond spoilage allowance
2. **Misprints** — errors in quality, placement, or color
3. **Garment defects** — manufacturer defects
4. **Overcharges** — billing errors caught post-invoicing
5. **Returns** — sizing issues or order changes

### Reprint Procedure

1. Customer sends photos of defective items
2. Shop evaluates whether within spoilage allowance
3. Shop sends shipping label for return of misprinted garments
4. **Production does NOT begin on reprints until misprints received**
5. Reprint ships at shop's expense

## Top 10 Invoicing Pain Points

1. Chasing late payments (87% paid late)
2. Cash flow gaps (fronting materials with Net 30 terms)
3. Quote-to-invoice disconnection (manual re-entry errors)
4. Accounting sync issues (one-directional, credit memos don't export)
5. Deposit tracking complexity
6. Tax complexity (resale certs, expirations, multi-state)
7. Change order management (mid-production changes)
8. Overrun/underrun reconciliation
9. Multiple payment methods (cash + check + Venmo = reconciliation nightmare)
10. Professional appearance (generic templates undermine credibility)
