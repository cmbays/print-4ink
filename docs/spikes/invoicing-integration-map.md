## Integration with Existing Verticals

### Quotes → Invoice Conversion

**Line Item Mapping:**

| Quote Field | Invoice Field |
|-------------|--------------|
| `quoteSchema.id` | `invoiceSchema.quoteId` |
| `quoteSchema.customerId` | `invoiceSchema.customerId` |
| `quoteSchema.quoteNumber` | reference number |
| `quoteSchema.lineItems[]` | `invoiceSchema.lineItems[]` (snapshot) |
| `quoteSchema.setupFees` | `invoiceSchema.lineItems[]` (type=setup) |
| `quoteSchema.discounts[]` | `invoiceSchema.discounts[]` (carried over) |
| `quoteSchema.shipping` | `invoiceSchema.shipping` (may update) |
| `quoteSchema.tax` | `invoiceSchema.taxAmount` (recalculated) |
| `quoteSchema.total` | `invoiceSchema.pricingSnapshot.quoteTotal` |

**Conversion Rules:**
- Only accepted quotes can generate invoices
- Invoice prices are LOCKED from the quote (never recalculated from current price matrix)
- A quote can generate one invoice (deposit + final tracked as partial payments on single invoice)
- Discounts carry over but can be modified
- Shipping may update at invoice time (actual vs estimated)
- Tax recalculated based on customer taxExempt status

### Customers → Invoicing

| Customer Field | Invoice Usage |
|----------------|-------------|
| `paymentTerms` | Determines `invoice.dueDate` calculation |
| `pricingTier` | Determines default deposit % and discount rules |
| `discountPercentage` | Auto-applied discount line on conversion |
| `taxExempt` | If true, tax = 0 |
| `taxExemptCertExpiry` | Validate cert is current before zeroing tax |
| `billingAddress` | Pre-fills invoice billing address |
| `shippingAddresses[]` | Pre-fills shipping address |
| `contacts[role=billing]` | Invoice recipient |

**New Fields Needed on Customer:**
- `defaultDepositPercent` — smart default for deposit requests
- `contractDepositAmount` — override for contract customers
- `creditLimit` — maximum outstanding AR balance
- `currentBalance` — computed outstanding amount
- `averageDaysToPayment` — historical payment velocity

### Artwork → Invoicing

| Artwork Event | Invoice Line Item |
|--------------|------------------|
| New artwork creation | "Artwork Setup — [name]" (flat fee, ~$40) |
| Artwork revision | "Artwork Revision — [name]" (hourly, ~$65/hr) |
| Complex custom art | "Custom Artwork — [name]" (quoted rate) |
| Camera-ready art | No charge (customer provided) |

### Screen Room → Invoicing

| Screen Event | Invoice Line | Typical Rate |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| New screen burn | "Screen Setup — [mesh] mesh" | $15-35/screen |
| Screen reclaim | "Screen Reclaim" | $5-10/screen |
| Color change | "Color Change" | $5/screen/color |
| Re-burn (after revision) | "Screen Re-burn" | $15-25/screen |

### Production/Kanban → Invoice Triggers

| Production State | Invoice Action |
|-----------------|---------------|
| design | Prompt: "Create invoice?" (with deposit request) |
| approval → shipped | No automatic invoice action |
| shipped | Prompt: "Job shipped — collect remaining balance?" |
| shipped + unpaid | Flag on dashboard as needing attention |

## Integration with Future Verticals

### Jobs → Invoicing (Job Costing)

```
QUOTE (Estimated)    JOB (Actual)        INVOICE (Billed)
garment: $150        garment: $165       garment: $150
labor: $200          labor: $240         labor: $200
setup: $40           setup: $40          setup: $40
─────────            ─────────           ─────────
total: $390          total: $445         total: $390
                     variance: -$55
quoted to cust: $765                     revenue: $765
margin: 49% (est)    actual: 42%         actual: 42%
```

### Reporting → Invoicing

| Invoice Data | Report Output |
|-------------|--------------|
| total, amountPaid | AR Aging (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+) |
| payments[].paymentDate | Payment Velocity (avg days by customer) |
| customerId + total | Customer Lifetime Value |
| lineItems + job.costing | Job Profitability (quoted vs actual vs billed) |
| total by month | Revenue Trends |
| discounts[].amount | Discount Impact (margin erosion) |
| status == "overdue" | Collections Dashboard |

### Shipping → Invoicing

| Shipping Event | Invoice Impact |
|---------------|---------------|
| Method selected | Add/update shipping line item |
| Tracking assigned | Attach to invoice for customer reference |
| Delivery confirmed | Start payment terms countdown |
| Split shipment | May need separate tracking |

### Inventory → Invoicing

| Inventory Data | Invoice Impact |
|---------------|---------------|
| garment.basePrice | COGS on job costing |
| sizes[].priceAdjustment | Size upcharge flows to invoice |
| Spoilage/waste | Absorbed cost (affects margin, not invoice) |
| Customer-supplied garments | Remove garment cost from invoice |

## Build Dependency Order

```
Phase 1a: Schema & Data
  1. invoice.ts schema
  2. credit-memo.ts schema
  3. Update note.ts (add "invoice")
  4. Add constants
  5. Mock data
  6. Schema tests
  7. Reverse lookup helpers

Phase 1b: List & Detail (read-only)
  8. Invoice List (/invoices)
  9. Invoice Detail (/invoices/[id])
  10. Sidebar nav link

Phase 1c: Quote-to-Invoice
  11. "Create Invoice" on Quote Detail
  12. CreateInvoiceModal
  13. Creation logic

Phase 1d: Payment Recording
  14. RecordPaymentSheet
  15. Payment list on detail
  16. Auto-status updates

Phase 1e: Customer Integration
  17. Invoices tab on Customer Detail
