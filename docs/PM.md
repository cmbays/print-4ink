## 1. Quick Reference

_Four common agent workflows as `gh` commands. Copy-paste these to interact with the issue tracker._
_All commands target `cmbays/print-4ink`. Project board: [Screen Print Pro](https://github.com/users/cmbays/projects/4)._

### Find work

```bash
# Priority/now issues (current cycle)
gh issue list -l priority/now --json number,title,labels,milestone

# Priority/next issues (up next)
gh issue list -l priority/next --json number,title,labels,milestone

# Issues assigned to a milestone
gh issue list --milestone "D-Day" --json number,title,state,labels

# Issues by product
gh issue list -l product/quotes --json number,title,state
```

### Create an issue

```bash
# Use a template (recommended — auto-applies type/* label)
gh issue create --template feature-request.yml \
  --title "[Feature] Add color preview" \
  --body "..." \
  --label "domain/colors,priority/next"

# Quick issue (add type/* + priority/* + domain/* labels manually)
gh issue create \
  --title "Fix price rounding on mobile" \
  --label "type/bug,priority/now,domain/pricing" \
  --body "..."
```

### Update status

```bash
# Add/remove labels
gh issue edit 123 --add-label "priority/now" --remove-label "priority/next"

# Assign to milestone
gh issue edit 123 --milestone "D-Day"

# Close with comment
gh issue close 123 --comment "Resolved in PR #456"
```

### Add a sub-issue

```bash
# Get node IDs
PARENT=$(gh issue view 144 --json id --jq '.id')
CHILD=$(gh issue view 250 --json id --jq '.id')

# Create sub-issue relationship
gh api graphql -f query="
  mutation {
    addSubIssue(input: {
      issueId: \"$PARENT\",
      subIssueId: \"$CHILD\"
    }) {
      issue { number }
      subIssue { number }
    }
  }"
```

## 2. Issue Lifecycle

_Issues flow through 6 statuses on the project board: Triage -> Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done._
_The Status field on the [project board](https://github.com/users/cmbays/projects/4) is the single source of truth for issue state._

### Status Flow

```
Created ──> Triage ──> Backlog ──> Ready ──> In Progress ──> In Review ──> Done
   │           │          │                      │               │
   │           │          │                      │               └─ PR merged
   │           │          └─ Groomed, labeled     └─ Agent working
   │           └─ Needs labels/triage
   └─ Auto-added to board by Action
```

| Status          | Meaning                                           | Who moves it                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Triage**      | New issue, needs labels and prioritization        | Human (during grooming)       |
| **Backlog**     | Labeled and groomed, not yet scheduled            | Human (during bet)            |
| **Ready**       | Scheduled for current cycle, fully contextualized | Human (during bet)            |
| **In Progress** | Agent or human actively working                   | Agent (at session start)      |
| **In Review**   | PR open, awaiting review/merge                    | Agent (when PR created)       |
| **Done**        | PR merged and issue closed                        | Automatic (PR close) or agent |

### Mapping to Labels

Status lives on the **board field**, not in labels. Labels encode stable metadata:

| Metadata          | Mechanism          | Example                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| What kind of work | `type/*` label     | `type/feature`, `type/bug`                   |
| When to do it     | `priority/*` label | `priority/now`, `priority/next`              |
| Which product     | `product/*` label  | `product/quotes`, `product/jobs`             |
| Which domain      | `domain/*` label   | `domain/pricing`, `domain/garments`          |
| Which tool        | `tool/*` label     | `tool/work-orchestrator`, `tool/ci-pipeline` |
| Pipeline type     | `pipeline/*` label | `pipeline/vertical`, `pipeline/horizontal`   |
| Which phase       | `phase/*` label    | `phase/1`                                    |
| How we found it   | `source/*` label   | `source/interview`, `source/review`          |
| Current state     | Board Status field | In Progress, In Review                       |
| Toward what goal  | Milestone          | D-Day                                        |

## 3. Label Taxonomy

_Every issue needs three labels: `type/_`+`priority/_` + one scope label (`product/_`, `domain/_`, or `tool/_`). Additional dimensions (`pipeline/_`, `phase/_`, `source/_`) are optional._
_Labels encode stable categorical metadata. Runtime state (status, effort, pipeline stage) lives on project board fields._

### Taxonomy Overview

The scope dimension uses three prefixes depending on the nature of the work:

| Prefix      | What it represents                              | Litmus test                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `product/*` | Things users DO                                 | "A user says: I need to go DO a \_\_\_"                     |
| `domain/*`  | Things products USE — configuration/entity data | "This is something products USE, not something users GO DO" |
| `tool/*`    | How we BUILD — developer infrastructure         | "Affects how we BUILD, not what we build"                   |

### Deprecated Labels (Pending Removal)

These `vertical/*` labels existed in the old taxonomy. They have been replaced by the `product/*`, `domain/*`, and `tool/*` dimensions above. They will be removed during the next grooming session.

| Old Label                      | Replacement                                                            |

| `vertical/screen-room`         | `domain/screens`                                                       |
| `vertical/price-matrix`        | `domain/pricing`                                                       |

| `vertical/mobile-optimization` | `domain/mobile`                                                        |
| `vertical/infrastructure`      | `tool/ci-pipeline` (infra) or nearest `tool/*`                         |

| `enhancement`                  | GitHub default — use `type/feature` instead                            |

### Rules

1. **Every issue needs `type/*` + `priority/*` + at least one scope label** (`product/*`, `domain/*`, or `tool/*`) — no exceptions
2. **One `type/*` per issue** — if it's both a feature and a refactor, pick the primary
3. **Multiple scope labels OK** — cross-cutting work can have 2+ labels (e.g., `product/quotes` + `domain/pricing`)
4. **`pipeline/*` is optional** — add to indicate the pipeline type for `work launch`
5. **`phase/*` is optional** — add when phase assignment is clear
6. **`source/*` is optional** — add when provenance matters (review findings, interview decisions)
7. **Templates auto-apply `type/*`** — agents still add `priority/*` + scope labels manually

---

## 4. Issue Templates

_Four YAML issue forms enforce structure. Blank issues are disabled — all issues go through a template._
_Templates auto-apply `type/_`labels. Agents and humans add`priority/_` + scope labels (`product/_`, `domain/_`, or `tool/_`) after creation.\*

### PR Template

Pull requests use `.github/pull_request_template.md` with these sections:

- **Summary** — 1-3 bullet points
- **Related Issues** — `Closes #X`
- **Type** — checkboxes: Feature, Bug Fix, Refactor, Tooling, Docs
- **Product/Tool** — checkboxes synced with `config/products.json` + `config/tools.json`
- **Screenshots** — before/after for UI changes
- **Test Plan** — what was tested
- **Quality Checklist** — build/test/typecheck + UI quality gates from CLAUDE.md

### Config

Blank issues are disabled (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`). All issues must use a template. General discussion goes to [Discussions](https://github.com/cmbays/print-4ink/discussions).

## 5. Dependency Patterns

_Three relationship types: hierarchy (sub-issues), dependency (blocked-by/blocking), and context (mentions)._
_Use hierarchy for decomposition, dependency for sequencing, and mentions for narrative cross-references._

### Hierarchy — Sub-Issues

"This is part of that." Decomposition into smaller work units.

```bash
# Add a sub-issue to a parent
PARENT=$(gh issue view 144 --json id --jq '.id')
CHILD=$(gh issue view 250 --json id --jq '.id')
gh api graphql -f query="
  mutation {
    addSubIssue(input: {
      issueId: \"$PARENT\",
      subIssueId: \"$CHILD\"
    }) {
      issue { number }
      subIssue { number }
    }
  }"

# View sub-issues of a parent (in GitHub UI, or via API)
gh issue view 144 --json title,body
```

**When to use**: Epic -> stage issues, tracking issue -> task issues, any parent-child decomposition.

### Dependency — Blocked-By / Blocking

"This must finish before that starts." Sequencing between issues.

```bash
# Note: GitHub's native dependency API is limited.
# Document blocking relationships in issue comments:
gh issue comment 250 --body "Blocked by #143 — needs schema migration first"

# For formal tracking, use sub-issue ordering within an epic
# (parent closes only when all children close)
```

**When to use**: Between pipeline stages (research -> interview -> shape), between build waves (wave 1 -> wave 2), between epics (epic A -> epic B). NOT within a wave (parallel tasks are concurrent).

### Context — Mentions

"This relates to that." Narrative cross-references for context.

```bash
# Mention in issue body or comment
gh issue comment 250 --body "Related to #144 — same pricing engine changes"
```

**When to use**: When issues share context but don't have a structural relationship. Related work in different verticals, background context.

### Summary

| Relationship | Mechanism             | Purpose       | Example                              |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Hierarchy    | Sub-issues            | Decomposition | Epic #144 -> Research, Build, Review |
| Dependency   | Comments + convention | Sequencing    | #250 blocked by #143                 |
| Context      | Issue mentions (`#N`) | Narrative     | "Related to #144"                    |

## 6. Epic Pattern

_Parent issue = goal or pipeline. Sub-issues = pipeline stages + build tasks. Issues are created progressively, not front-loaded._
_Epic progress = closed sub-issues / total sub-issues. Milestone progress = closed epics / total epics._

### Structure

```
Milestone: D-Day
├── Epic #144: DTF Pricing (parent issue)
│   ├── Sub-issue: Research
│   ├── Sub-issue: Interview
│   ├── Sub-issue: Shape
│   ├── Sub-issue: Breadboard
│   ├── Sub-issue: Plan
│   ├── Sub-issue: Build Wave 1
│   ├── Sub-issue: Build Wave 2 (depends on Wave 1)
│   ├── Sub-issue: Review (depends on all Build waves)
│   └── Sub-issue: Wrap-up (depends on Review)
├── Epic #145: Wizards
└── Epic #177: Pricing Mobile
```

### Progressive Issue Creation

Issues are created as the pipeline advances, not all at once:

1. **Epic created** -> only Research sub-issue exists
2. **Research complete** -> creates Interview sub-issue
3. **Interview complete** -> creates Shape sub-issue
4. **Shape complete** -> creates Breadboard sub-issue
5. **Breadboard complete** -> creates Plan sub-issue
6. **Plan complete** -> creates all Build + Review + Wrap-up sub-issues (with wave dependencies)

This prevents stale issues and ensures each sub-issue has full context from the previous stage.

### Creating an Epic

```bash
# 1. Create the parent (epic) issue
gh issue create \
  --title "[Tracking] DTF Pricing Pipeline" \
  --template tracking-issue.yml \
  --label "type/tooling,priority/now,domain/dtf,pipeline/vertical" \
  --milestone "D-Day"

# 2. Create first stage sub-issue
gh issue create \
  --title "[Research] DTF Pricing — competitor analysis" \
  --template research-task.yml \
  --label "type/research,priority/now,domain/dtf"

# 3. Link as sub-issue (see Section 5 for GraphQL command)
```

### Progress Measurement

- **Epic progress**: closed sub-issues / total sub-issues (visible in GitHub UI sub-issue list)
- **Milestone progress**: closed issues assigned to milestone / total (visible in Milestones UI)
- **Board view**: filter by milestone to see all work toward a goal

---

## 7. Pipeline Flow

_Pipeline ID format: `YYYYMMDD-topic` (e.g., `20260215-pm-overhaul`). Stages tracked via project board Pipeline Stage field._
_Each pipeline advances through: Research -> Interview -> Shape -> Breadboard -> Plan -> Build -> Review -> Wrap-up._

### Pipeline Stages

From `config/stages.json`:

| Stage      | Description                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Research   | Competitor analysis, domain research                 |
| Interview  | User/owner interview for requirements                |
| Shape      | R x S methodology — requirements, shapes, fit checks |
| Breadboard | Affordance mapping, wiring, vertical slices          |
| Plan       | Implementation planning, wave design                 |
| Build      | Code implementation across waves                     |
| Review     | Quality gate, design audit, PR review                |
| Wrap-up    | KB docs, progress updates, cleanup                   |

### Pipeline ID

Every pipeline gets a unique ID in the format `YYYYMMDD-topic`:

- `20260215-pm-overhaul`
- `20260210-dtf-pricing`
- `20260205-garment-catalog`

The Pipeline ID is set on the project board's **Pipeline ID** text field. The **Pipeline Stage** field tracks where the pipeline currently is.

### Issue Creation During Pipeline

As a pipeline advances through stages, agents create issues for the current stage:

```bash
# Create a stage issue
gh issue create \
  --title "[Research] DTF Pricing — competitor analysis" \
  --template research-task.yml \
  --label "type/research,priority/now,domain/dtf"

# Link as sub-issue of the epic (Section 5 commands)
# Update Pipeline Stage field on the board (via web UI or GraphQL)
```

### KB Session Docs

Every pipeline stage that produces artifacts should create a KB session doc:

```
knowledge-base/src/content/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-topic.md
```

See `CLAUDE.md` Knowledge Base section for the format.

## 8. Agent Conventions

_Agents find work via `priority/_`labels, create issues via templates, and update status via`gh issue edit`.*
*Comment routing: `@cmbays` for human-needed decisions. Regular comments for agent-to-agent context.\*

### Finding Work

At session start, agents should:

1. Read `PROGRESS.md` if it exists (generated by `work progress`)
2. Check assigned issues: `gh issue list -l priority/now --json number,title,labels`
3. Check the session prompt (`.session-prompt.md`) for specific task instructions
4. Read the implementation plan if one is referenced

### Creating Issues

Agents create issues when they discover work outside their current task scope:

```bash
# Use a template — gets auto-label
gh issue create --template feature-request.yml \
  --title "[Feature] Discovered need for X" \
  --label "product/quotes,priority/next" \
  --body "..."

# For deferred review items
gh issue create \
  --title "Address CodeRabbit feedback on QuoteForm" \
  --label "type/tech-debt,priority/later,product/quotes,source/review" \
  --body "..."
```

### Updating Status

```bash
# Starting work
gh issue edit 123 --add-label "priority/now"

# Work complete
gh issue close 123 --comment "Resolved in PR #456"

# Defer to next cycle
gh issue edit 123 --remove-label "priority/now" --add-label "priority/next"
```

### Comment Routing

| Audience       | Convention                   | Example                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human needed   | Include `@cmbays` in comment | "**@cmbays** — need a decision on pricing tier structure" |
| Agent-to-agent | Regular comment, no mention  | "Completed research phase. Findings in spike doc."        |
| Status update  | Regular comment              | "PR #280 addresses this. Moving to In Review."            |

**Rule**: Only use `@cmbays` when a human decision or action is genuinely required. Agent-to-agent comments should NOT trigger notifications.

### Agent Issue Checklist

When creating any issue, agents must ensure:

- [ ] Has `type/*` label (or use a template that auto-applies it)
- [ ] Has `priority/*` label
- [ ] Has at least one scope label: `product/*`, `domain/*`, or `tool/*`
- [ ] Body has enough context for another agent to pick it up
- [ ] "Files to Read" section populated if relevant
- [ ] Linked to parent issue as sub-issue if part of an epic

## 9. Milestones & Cycles

_Milestones represent Shape Up cycles. Three human touchpoints per cycle: Bet, Interview, Smoke Test._
_Cooldown between cycles: smoke test -> polish -> push to prod -> close milestone -> bet next cycle._

### Shape Up Rhythm

```
Milestone opens
  └── Pipelines run (Research -> Interview -> Shape -> Build -> Review)
        └── All work done
              └── Cooldown begins
                    ├── Smoke Test (human QA on preview)
                    ├── Polish (bug fixes, UX tweaks)
                    ├── Push to prod
                    ├── Close milestone + tag release
                    └── Bet (review backlog -> groom -> open new milestone)
                          └── Next milestone begins
```

### Three Human Touchpoints

| Touchpoint     | When            | What happens                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bet**        | During Cooldown | Human selects issues from backlog for next cycle. Agent assists grooming: adds labels, links dependencies, fills "Files to Read", drafts acceptance criteria. |
| **Interview**  | During Pipeline | Human provides domain decisions and requirements validation. Agent records decisions in interview notes.                                                      |
| **Smoke Test** | During Cooldown | Human QA on preview deployment. Finds bugs, UX issues, missing features. Creates issues for anything found.                                                   |

Everything between these touchpoints is agent-automatable.

### Bet Phase Workflow

1. Human selects issues from backlog ("let's do X, Y, Z next")
2. Agent assists grooming: adds labels, links dependencies, fills context
3. Agent posts `@cmbays` comments on issues where context is missing
4. Human answers async (could be hours/days)
5. Issues are fully contextualized and ready for research

### Current Milestones

```bash
# List milestones
gh api repos/cmbays/print-4ink/milestones --jq '.[] | "\(.title) — \(.open_issues)/\(.open_issues + .closed_issues) open — due \(.due_on)"'
```

## 10. Automation

_Three layers: GitHub Actions handle event-driven automation, agents handle workflow execution, humans handle strategy._
_Actions are the safety net. The `work` CLI is the agent happy path._

### What Actions Handle

| Action                   | Trigger                                            | What it does                                                                   | File                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-add to project**  | Issue opened, PR opened/ready_for_review           | Adds to [Screen Print Pro](https://github.com/users/cmbays/projects/4) board   | `.github/workflows/auto-project.yml`                    |
| **PR Labeler**           | PR opened/synchronized (via `pull_request_target`) | Applies `product/*` / `domain/*` / `tool/*` labels based on changed file paths | `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` + `.github/labeler.yml` |
| **Template auto-labels** | Issue created via template                         | Applies `type/*` label from template's `labels:` field                         | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`                          |
| **CI**                   | Push/PR                                            | Build, test, typecheck                                                         | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`                              |

### PR Labeler Path Mapping

From `.github/labeler.yml`:

| Path Pattern                                                 | Label             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `app/(dashboard)/quotes/**`                                  | `product/quotes`  |
| `app/(dashboard)/jobs/**`                                    | `product/jobs`    |
| `app/(dashboard)/garments/**`                                | `domain/garments` |
| `app/(dashboard)/settings/pricing/**`                        | `domain/pricing`  |
| `app/(dashboard)/settings/colors/**`                         | `domain/colors`   |
| `knowledge-base/**`, `scripts/**`, `config/**`, `.github/**` | `tool/pm-system`  |

Cross-cutting paths (`lib/schemas/**`, `docs/**`, `components/ui/**`) are deliberately unmapped — not every PR needs an auto-label.

### What Agents Handle

| Task            | How                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Find work       | Read `PROGRESS.md`, query `gh issue list -l priority/now`    |
| Create issues   | `gh issue create --template ...` with required labels        |
| Update status   | `gh issue edit` to add/remove labels, assign milestones      |
| Link sub-issues | GraphQL `addSubIssue` mutation                               |
| Create PRs      | `gh pr create` with template body                            |
| Close issues    | `gh issue close --comment "Resolved in PR #N"`               |
| Write KB docs   | Create session doc in `knowledge-base/src/content/sessions/` |

### What Humans Handle

| Task                       | When                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Grooming**               | During Bet phase — triage labels, set priorities, close stale |
| **Closing issues**         | Final authority on close decisions                            |
| **Milestone management**   | Create milestones, set due dates, select issues               |
| **Priority/now selection** | Decide what's actively worked on                              |
| **Strategy**               | Bet phase decisions, pipeline selection, scope cuts           |
| **PAT management**         | Provide and rotate `PROJECT_PAT` secret for Actions           |

### Planned Automation (Post-D-Day Backlog)

| Priority | Action                          | Description                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Sub-issue cascade check         | When sub-issue closes, update parent status |
| 2        | PROGRESS.md auto-generation     | Generate on push to main                    |
| 3        | Stale issue management          | Weekly schedule, auto-label stale issues    |
| 4        | Milestone progress notification | Notify on milestone progress changes        |
| 5        | Pipeline stage advance          | Backup to `work stage complete`             |
