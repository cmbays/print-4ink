## 1. Why DDD? Industry Context

### What Is Domain-Driven Design?

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software design approach introduced by Eric Evans in 2003. The core idea: **software should reflect the business domain it serves, and everyone building it should speak the same language as the people who understand the business.** Everything else — bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, value objects — are patterns that help achieve that goal.

DDD has two halves:

| Half | Focus | Key Patterns |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Strategic Design** | How to break a complex domain into manageable pieces | Bounded Contexts, Context Maps, Core/Supporting/Generic domains |
| **Tactical Design** | How to model the domain within each piece | Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Events, Repositories |

### Why the Industry Uses It

| Problem DDD Solves | How | Screen Print Pro Relevance |
|--------------------|-----|---------------------------|
| **Ambiguous vocabulary** | Ubiquitous Language — one term, one meaning, everywhere | "Screen" means a mesh frame in production, but a UI view in dev. "Job" means a production order, not a background task. |
| **God objects** | Bounded Contexts separate models that mean different things | A `Customer` in quoting (contact + pricing tier) is different from a `Customer` in invoicing (billing address + payment terms). |
| **Unclear ownership** | Each bounded context has clear boundaries and responsibilities | Prevents "whose schema is this?" conflicts when multiple verticals touch the same data. |
| **Tangled dependencies** | Aggregates enforce transaction boundaries, contexts communicate via events | Prevents a change to pricing from cascading into job, invoice, and dashboard code. |
| **Premature coupling** | Strategic design separates core domain from supporting infrastructure | Pricing rules (core) shouldn't be tangled with email delivery (generic). |

### Why DDD Now for Screen Print Pro

We're transitioning from Phase 1 (frontend mockups) to Phase 2 (backend + real data). This is the ideal moment to establish DDD as our architectural lens because:

1. **Schemas are defined but not yet persisted** — we can restructure without migrating data.
2. **The flat `vertical/*` label namespace** doesn't distinguish between things users DO (products) and things products USE (domains). This causes confusion in issue triage and pipeline orchestration.
3. **Backend architecture decisions are imminent** — database schema, API design, and state management all need a domain model to guide them.
4. **The taxonomy feeds automation** — `work define` (planned) will infer pipeline type from labels. Getting the classification right now prevents rework later.

### What DDD Is NOT for Us

- **Not a folder restructuring exercise.** We don't need `domain/`, `application/`, `infrastructure/` directories in Phase 1.
- **Not microservices.** Screen Print Pro is a monolith, and that's correct for a solo-dev + AI team. DDD bounded contexts map to logical modules, not physical services.
- **Not academic purity.** We adapt DDD pragmatically. Evans himself says: "DDD is not about applying patterns — it's about understanding the domain."

## 2. DDD Concepts Applied to Screen Print Pro

### Ubiquitous Language

Our ubiquitous language is the vocabulary Gary (shop owner) uses. When Gary says a word, our code should use that exact word.

| Gary Says | Code Uses | NOT |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| "Quote" | `Quote`, `quoteSchema` | `Estimate`, `Proposal`, `Bid` |
| "Job" | `Job`, `jobSchema` | `Order`, `WorkOrder`, `Task` |
| "Screen" | `Screen`, `screenSchema` | `StencilFrame`, `PrintTemplate` |
| "Press" (production stage) | `"press"` lane/state | `"printing"`, `"production"` |
| "Burn" (screen prep) | `burnStatus: "burned"` | `"exposed"`, `"prepared"` |
| "Hit" (color application) | `ratePerHit` | `"colorPass"`, `"impression"` |
| "Gang sheet" (DTF layout) | `gangSheet`, `sheetCalculation` | `"layout"`, `"composition"` |
| "Mesh count" (screen spec) | `meshCount` | `"threadCount"`, `"screenDensity"` |

**Rule**: When adding new entities, ask Gary what he calls it. If Gary doesn't have a word for it, that's a signal it may be infrastructure, not domain.

### Bounded Contexts

A bounded context is a boundary within which a particular model is defined. The same real-world concept can have different representations in different contexts.

**Example — "Customer" across contexts:**

| Context | What "Customer" Means | Key Attributes |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Quoting** | Someone we're pricing work for | `name`, `pricingTier`, `favoriteGarments`, `tag` |
| **Invoicing** | Someone we're billing | `billingAddress`, `paymentTerms`, `taxExempt`, `balanceDue` |
| **Production** | Whose job this is (for art approval, pickup) | `name`, `contacts[].role === "art-approver"` |
| **CRM** | Full relationship record | All fields — the "source of truth" |

In Phase 1, we have a single `customerSchema` that serves all contexts. In Phase 2, each bounded context will read from a shared customer aggregate but project only the fields it needs.

### Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates

| DDD Concept | Definition | Screen Print Pro Examples |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Entity** | Has a unique identity; two instances with the same data are still different objects | `Quote`, `Job`, `Customer`, `Invoice`, `Screen` |
| **Value Object** | Defined by its attributes, not identity; immutable, interchangeable | `Address`, `Money` (via big.js), `PrintLocationDetail`, `GarmentSize`, `QuantityTier` |
| **Aggregate** | Cluster of entities + value objects treated as a single unit for data changes; has a root entity | `Quote` (root) + `QuoteLineItem[]` + `PrintLocationDetail[]`; `Job` (root) + `JobTask[]` + `JobNote[]` |
| **Aggregate Root** | The entity that controls access to everything inside the aggregate | `Quote` owns its line items; `Job` owns its tasks. External code references by root ID only. |
| **Domain Event** | Something that happened in the domain; past tense, immutable fact | `QuoteAccepted`, `JobMovedToPress`, `InvoicePaid`, `ScreenBurned` |
| **Repository** | Abstraction for aggregate persistence | `QuoteRepository.findById()`, `JobRepository.findByLane()` (Phase 2) |
| **Application Service** | Orchestrates use cases by coordinating domain objects | `CreateQuoteService`, `MoveJobToLaneService` (Phase 2) |

### Current Schema → DDD Mapping

| Schema File | DDD Role | Aggregate? | Root? |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| `quote.ts` | Entity | Yes — owns `lineItems[]`, `dtfLineItems[]`, `discounts[]` | Quote |
| `job.ts` | Entity | Yes — owns `tasks[]`, `notes[]`, `history[]`, `garmentDetails[]` | Job |
| `customer.ts` | Entity | Yes — owns `contacts[]`, `groups[]`, `shippingAddresses[]` | Customer |
| `invoice.ts` | Entity | Yes — owns `lineItems[]`, `payments[]` (implied), `auditLog[]` | Invoice |
| `screen.ts` | Entity | No — belongs to Job context (linked via `jobId`) | — |
| `garment.ts` | Value Object (catalog) + Entity (instance) | `GarmentCatalog` is an entity in the Catalog context; `Garment` is a value object within Job | — |
| `price-matrix.ts` | Entity | Yes — `PricingTemplate` owns `matrix`, `costConfig` | PricingTemplate |
| `artwork.ts` | Entity | No — referenced by Quote and Job via IDs | — |
| `address.ts` | Value Object | No — embedded in Customer | — |
| `contact.ts` | Entity | No — owned by Customer aggregate | — |
| `color-preferences.ts` | Value Object | No — configuration data | — |
| `credit-memo.ts` | Entity | Yes — owns `lineItems[]` | CreditMemo |
| `dtf-pricing.ts` | Entity | Yes — `DTFPricingTemplate` owns tiers, fees, discounts | DTFPricingTemplate |
| `dtf-line-item.ts` | Value Object | No — embedded in Quote | — |

## 3. Classification Definitions — Product / Domain / Tool

### The Three-Way Taxonomy

| Dimension | DDD Layer | Definition | Config File |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Product** | Application Services (use cases) | Workflow app with its own user journey and primary navigation | `config/products.json` |
| **Domain** | Domain Model (entities, value objects, rules) | Business entity/concept that products operate on; no standalone workflow | `config/domains.json` |
| **Tool** | Infrastructure Layer | Developer infrastructure outside the app | `config/tools.json` |

### Litmus Tests

#### Product vs. Domain

| Test | Product (Workflow) | Domain (Configuration) |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **User says...** | "I need to go **do** a ___" | "I need to **set up** my ___" |
| **Has lifecycle** | create → process → complete | create → configure → reference |
| **Primary action** | Execute a business process | Define data that processes use |
| **If removed** | A business capability disappears | Products lose access to shared data |
| **Navigation** | Has sidebar/primary nav entry | Sub-page under settings, or no page |
| **Owns a user journey** | Yes — multi-step workflow with state transitions | No — CRUD configuration or lookup |
| **Board visibility** | Shows up on Kanban/job board | Never appears on a board |

#### Domain vs. Tool

| Test | Domain | Tool |
|------|--------|------|
| **Who uses it** | End users (Gary) via the app | Developers/agents during build |
| **Visible to Gary** | Yes — appears in app UI | No — invisible to end users |
| **Deploys with the app** | Yes — part of the production bundle | Usually not — CI, scripts, skills |
| **Business language** | Uses Gary's vocabulary | Uses developer vocabulary |

### Classification Table

#### Products (things users DO)

| Slug | Label | Route | Bounded Context | User Action |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| `dashboard` | Dashboard | `/dashboard` | Operations Overview | "Check what's blocked" |
| `quotes` | Quotes | `/quotes` | Sales / Quoting | "Create a quote for DTF" |
| `customers` | Customers | `/customers` | CRM | "Look up Gary's account" |
| `invoices` | Invoices | `/invoices` | Billing | "Send invoice for job #1024" |
| `jobs` | Jobs | `/jobs` | Production | "Check press schedule" |

#### Domains (things products USE)

| Slug | Label | Why Domain, Not Product | Products That Consume It |
|------|-------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| `garments` | Garments | Referenced by Quotes + Jobs; catalog lookup, no workflow | Quotes, Jobs |
| `screens` | Screens | Referenced by Jobs; entity tracking, not standalone workflow | Jobs |
| `pricing` | Pricing | Consumed by Quotes; rules engine, not user workflow | Quotes |
| `colors` | Colors | Configuration data for production and quoting | Quotes, Jobs, Settings |
| `dtf` | DTF | Service type with distinct quoting/production rules | Quotes, Jobs |
| `screen-printing` | Screen Printing | Default production process type | Quotes, Jobs |
| `artwork` | Artwork | Asset management referenced by Quotes + Jobs | Quotes, Jobs |
| `mobile` | Mobile | Cross-cutting UX concern; no nav entry | All products |

#### Tools (how we BUILD)

| Slug | Label | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `work-orchestrator` | Work Orchestrator | Pipeline orchestration scripts |
| `skills-framework` | Skills Framework | AI skill definitions |
| `agent-system` | Agent System | AI agent definitions |
| `knowledge-base` | Knowledge Base | Astro documentation site |
| `ci-pipeline` | CI Pipeline | GitHub Actions workflows |
| `pm-system` | PM System | Labels, templates, project board |

### Context Relationships

| Upstream Context | Downstream Context | Relationship | Mechanism |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Quoting | Production | Customer-Supplier | Quote acceptance creates a Job. Job references `sourceQuoteId`. |
| Production | Billing | Customer-Supplier | Job completion triggers invoice creation. Invoice references `jobId`. |
| CRM | Quoting, Production, Billing | Shared Kernel | All contexts reference `customerId`. CRM owns the Customer aggregate. |
| Garment Catalog | Quoting, Production | Shared Kernel | Garment data (SKU, sizes, pricing) shared via catalog lookup. |
| Pricing Engine | Quoting | Conformist | Quoting conforms to pricing rules. PricingTemplate defines the rate structure. |
| Artwork Library | Quoting, Production | Shared Kernel | Artwork IDs referenced by both Quotes and Jobs. |

### Core vs. Supporting vs. Generic

| Classification | Context | Rationale |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Core Domain** | Quoting, Production | These are the business differentiators. How Gary quotes and runs production is what makes 4Ink competitive. |
| **Supporting Domain** | Billing, CRM | Important but not differentiating. Standard invoicing and customer management patterns. |
| **Generic Domain** | Auth, Notifications, File Storage | Commodity infrastructure. Use off-the-shelf solutions (Supabase Auth, email services, S3). |

---

## 5. Data Architecture Implications (Phase 2)

### Database Schema Principles

DDD tells us how to structure our database in Phase 2:

#### 1. One Table Per Aggregate Root

Each aggregate root becomes a primary table. Aggregate internals are either embedded (JSONB) or in child tables with foreign keys to the root.

```
quotes (aggregate root)
├── quote_line_items (child table, FK → quotes.id)
├── quote_dtf_line_items (child table, FK → quotes.id)
└── quote_discounts (child table, FK → quotes.id)

jobs (aggregate root)
├── job_tasks (child table, FK → jobs.id)
├── job_notes (child table, FK → jobs.id)
└── job_history (child table, FK → jobs.id)

customers (aggregate root)
├── contacts (child table, FK → customers.id)
├── customer_addresses (child table, FK → customers.id)
└── customer_groups (child table, FK → customers.id)

invoices (aggregate root)
├── invoice_line_items (child table, FK → invoices.id)
├── payments (child table, FK → invoices.id)
└── audit_log (child table, FK → invoices.id)
```

#### 2. Cross-Aggregate References by ID Only

Aggregates reference each other by ID, never by embedding the full object. This enforces loose coupling.

```sql
-- quotes.customer_id → customers.id  (FK)
-- jobs.source_quote_id → quotes.id   (FK, nullable)
-- invoices.job_id → jobs.id          (FK, nullable)
-- screens.job_id → jobs.id           (FK)
```

#### 3. Domain Configuration Tables

Domain entities that serve as shared configuration get their own tables, separate from the bounded context tables:

```
-- Shared Kernel tables
garment_catalog       -- Garment styles, sizes, pricing
pricing_templates     -- Screen print + DTF pricing matrices
color_config          -- Ink colors, PMS codes
artworks              -- Uploaded artwork files + metadata
```

#### 4. Event Sourcing Readiness

Our existing `job.history[]` and `invoice.auditLog[]` already capture domain events. In Phase 2, consider an `events` table for cross-context event publishing:

```sql
domain_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  aggregate_type TEXT,      -- 'quote', 'job', 'invoice'
  aggregate_id UUID,
  event_type TEXT,          -- 'QuoteAccepted', 'JobMovedToPress'
  payload JSONB,
  occurred_at TIMESTAMPTZ
)
```

This enables:
- Audit trail across all contexts
- Async reactions (e.g., auto-create job when quote is accepted)
- Dashboard projections (Operations context reads events, never writes them)

### Supabase-Specific Patterns

| DDD Concept | Supabase Implementation |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Repository | Supabase client queries wrapped in service functions |
| Aggregate loading | `supabase.from('quotes').select('*, line_items(*), dtf_items(*)')` |
| Domain events | Supabase Realtime subscriptions on `domain_events` table |
| Read models (Dashboard) | Supabase Views or materialized queries |
| Authorization | Row-Level Security (RLS) policies per context |

---

## 6. PM Tooling Integration

### Label Migration: `vertical/*` → `product/*` / `domain/*` / `tool/*`

The flat `vertical/*` namespace merges products, domains, and tools into one dimension. DDD tells us to separate them.

#### New Label Taxonomy

| Dimension | Prefix | Color | Count | Examples |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| Product | `product/` | `#2563EB` (blue) | 5 | `product/quotes`, `product/jobs` |
| Domain | `domain/` | `#7C3AED` (purple) | 7 | `domain/garments`, `domain/pricing` |
| Tool | `tool/` | `#0EA5E9` (sky) | 6 | `tool/knowledge-base`, `tool/pm-system` |
| Pipeline | `pipeline/` | `#F59E0B` (amber) | 4 | `pipeline/vertical`, `pipeline/horizontal` |

#### Migration Mapping

| Old Label | New Label | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| `vertical/dashboard` | `product/dashboard` | User workflow ("Check what's blocked") |
| `vertical/quoting` | `product/quotes` | User workflow ("Create a quote") |
| `vertical/customers` | `product/customers` | User workflow ("Look up an account") |
| `vertical/invoicing` | `product/invoices` | User workflow ("Send an invoice") |
| `vertical/jobs` | `product/jobs` | User workflow ("Check press schedule") |
| `vertical/garments` | `domain/garments` | Catalog data used by Quotes + Jobs |
| `vertical/screen-room` | `domain/screens` | Entity data used by Jobs |
| `vertical/price-matrix` | `domain/pricing` | Rules engine consumed by Quotes |
| `vertical/colors` | `domain/colors` | Configuration data |
| `vertical/dtf` | `domain/dtf` | Service type modifier |
| `vertical/mobile-optimization` | `domain/mobile` | Cross-cutting UX concern |
| `vertical/infrastructure` | Triage into `tool/*` | Each issue re-labeled to specific tool |
| `vertical/devx` | Triage into `tool/*` | Each issue re-labeled to specific tool |

#### Issue Template Updates

The "Product/Tool" dropdown in issue templates becomes three dropdowns:

| Template Field | Options Source | Required |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Product | `config/products.json` | If the issue is about a product workflow |
| Domain | `config/domains.json` | If the issue is about domain data/rules |
| Tool | `config/tools.json` | If the issue is about build infrastructure |

At least one must be selected. Cross-cutting issues can have multiple.

#### Project Board Field Updates

| Current Field | New Field(s) | Type |
|---------------|-------------|------|
| Product (single select) | Product (single select) | Options from `products.json` |
| — (new) | Domain (single select) | Options from `domains.json` |
| Tool (single select) | Tool (single select) | Options from `tools.json` (unchanged) |

---

## 7. Work Orchestrator Integration

### Pipeline Type Inference

The work orchestrator can infer pipeline type from labels:

```bash
# Product label → vertical pipeline (full 8-stage)
product/quotes → pipeline/vertical

# Domain label → horizontal pipeline (research → plan → build → review → wrap-up)
domain/pricing → pipeline/horizontal

# Tool label → horizontal pipeline
tool/pm-system → pipeline/horizontal

# Bug label override → bug-fix pipeline regardless of product/domain
type/bug → pipeline/bug-fix
```

#### Inference Rules (for `work define`)

```
1. If type/bug → pipeline/bug-fix
2. If product/* AND type/feature → pipeline/vertical
3. If domain/* → pipeline/horizontal
4. If tool/* → pipeline/horizontal
5. If type/feedback OR type/ux-review → pipeline/polish
6. Default → pipeline/horizontal
```

### Pipeline Stages per Classification

| Classification | Pipeline | Stages |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Product feature | Vertical | Research → Interview → Shape → Breadboard → Plan → Build → Review → Wrap-up |
| Domain feature | Horizontal | Research → Plan → Build → Review → Wrap-up |
| Tool feature | Horizontal | Research → Plan → Build → Review → Wrap-up |
| Product polish | Polish | Interview → Shape → Breadboard → Plan → Build → Review → Wrap-up |
| Any bug | Bug-fix | Build → Review → Wrap-up |

### KB Session Doc Metadata

The KB session doc frontmatter field `vertical` maps to the new taxonomy. Since `vertical` is the existing field name, we maintain backward compatibility:

| Old `vertical` value | New meaning | How to read it |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `dashboard` | Product | Cross-reference with `products.json` |
| `garments` | Domain | Cross-reference with `domains.json` |
| `work-orchestrator` | Tool | Cross-reference with `tools.json` |

The KB schema can add a `classification` computed field in a future migration.

## 8. Routing, State, Schema, and API Patterns

### Routing

| Classification | Route Pattern | Examples |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| **Product** | `/[product-slug]` or `/[product-slug]/[id]` | `/quotes`, `/quotes/123`, `/jobs`, `/customers/456` |
| **Domain (settings)** | `/settings/[domain-slug]` | `/settings/pricing`, `/settings/colors` |
| **Domain (embedded)** | No standalone route — appears within product pages | Garment selector inside quote form |
| **Domain (catalog)** | `/[domain-slug]` when standalone browsing is needed | `/garments` (catalog browse, not a workflow) |

**Decision criteria for domain routing:**
- If the domain entity needs standalone CRUD → `/settings/[slug]` (e.g., pricing templates)
- If the domain entity is primarily selected within a product → embedded component (e.g., garment picker in quote form)
- If the domain entity needs a browse/search experience → top-level route with read-only focus (e.g., `/garments` catalog)

### State Management

| Classification | State Strategy | Rationale |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Product** | URL params for filters + React state for forms | Products have complex multi-step workflows with filters, pagination, detail views |
| **Domain (settings)** | React state (form) + save-to-server | Configuration is typically edit-one-record-at-a-time |
| **Domain (embedded)** | Lifted into parent product's state | Garment selection state lives in the quote form, not in a garment context |

### Schema Organization (Phase 2)

```
lib/
  schemas/
    # Aggregate roots — one file per aggregate
    quote.ts              # Quote aggregate (root + line items + discounts)
    job.ts                # Job aggregate (root + tasks + notes + history)
    customer.ts           # Customer aggregate (root + contacts + addresses)
    invoice.ts            # Invoice aggregate (root + line items + payments)

    # Domain entities — shared kernel
    garment.ts            # Garment catalog + value objects
    price-matrix.ts       # Pricing templates + cost config
    screen.ts             # Screen entity (belongs to Job context)
    artwork.ts            # Artwork entity
    color.ts              # Color definitions
    color-preferences.ts  # Color preference value objects
    dtf-pricing.ts        # DTF pricing template
    dtf-line-item.ts      # DTF line item value object

    # Cross-cutting value objects
    address.ts            # Address value object
    contact.ts            # Contact entity (owned by Customer)
    credit-memo.ts        # CreditMemo aggregate
    note.ts               # Note value object
```

**Principle**: Aggregate schemas import value objects, never the reverse. Domain schemas never import from product schemas.

### API Design (Phase 2)

| Classification | API Pattern | Examples |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| **Product** | Resource-oriented REST with actions | `POST /api/quotes`, `POST /api/quotes/123/accept`, `PATCH /api/jobs/456/move-to-lane` |
| **Domain (CRUD)** | Standard REST | `GET /api/garments`, `PUT /api/pricing-templates/789` |
| **Domain (computation)** | Function endpoints | `POST /api/pricing/calculate` (stateless price computation) |
| **Cross-context** | Orchestration endpoints | `POST /api/quotes/123/convert-to-job` (creates Job from Quote) |

**API boundary rule**: An API endpoint belongs to the bounded context that owns the aggregate it modifies. `POST /api/quotes/123/accept` lives in the Quoting context, even though it triggers Job creation in the Production context (via domain event).

## 9. Decision Framework — Classifying New Entities

When a new concept is introduced, use this flowchart:

```

### Worked Examples

#### Example 1: "Embroidery service type"

1. Is it visible to Gary? **Yes** — Gary quotes embroidery jobs.
2. Does Gary say "I need to go DO embroidery"? **No** — he says "I need to **create a quote** for embroidery." The workflow is quoting. Embroidery is a service type modifier.
3. Does it have its own multi-step workflow? **No** — it modifies the quoting and production workflows.
4. **Classification: Domain** (`domain/embroidery`) — similar to DTF. It's a service type with distinct pricing rules, not a standalone product.
5. **Implementation**: Add `"embroidery"` to `serviceTypeEnum`, create `embroidery-pricing.ts` schema, add embroidery options to quote form.

#### Example 2: "Customer portal"

1. Is it visible to Gary? **Yes** — but it's visible to Gary's **customers**, not Gary himself.
2. Does a customer say "I need to go DO a ___"? **Yes** — "I need to check my order status", "I need to approve artwork."
3. Does it have a multi-step workflow? **Yes** — view orders, approve artwork, download invoices.
4. **Classification: Product** (`product/customer-portal`) — it's a distinct application surface with its own user journey.
5. **Implementation**: New bounded context (Customer Portal), new routes, new navigation. References existing aggregates (Job, Quote, Invoice) but has its own read models.

#### Example 3: "Tax rate configuration"

1. Is it visible to Gary? **Yes** — Gary sets tax rates.
2. Does Gary say "I need to go DO tax rates"? **No** — he says "I need to **set up** my tax rate."
3. Does it have a multi-step workflow? **No** — it's a single value (percentage) configured once.
4. **Classification**: Not even a domain — it's a **value object** within the Billing context. Add `taxRate` field to a settings schema.

#### Example 4: "Shopify integration"

1. Is it visible to Gary? **Indirectly** — orders flow in from Shopify.
2. Does Gary say "I need to go DO Shopify"? **No** — he says "I need to **set up** my Shopify connection."
3. It's configuration + background sync, not a workflow.
4. **Classification: Domain** (`domain/integrations` or `domain/shopify`) — it's a data pipeline that feeds into the Quoting and Production contexts.

### Quick Reference Card

| Signal | Classification | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Has sidebar nav entry + multi-step workflow | **Product** | Add to `products.json`, create route group |
| Referenced by 2+ products, no standalone workflow | **Domain** | Add to `domains.json`, schema in shared kernel |
| CRUD settings page only | **Domain** | Add to `domains.json`, route under `/settings/` |
| Service type modifier (like DTF, embroidery) | **Domain** | Add to `domains.json`, extend `serviceTypeEnum` |
| Developer tooling, CI, scripts | **Tool** | Add to `tools.json` |
| Single field or config value | **Value Object** | Add to existing schema, no new classification needed |

## 10. Domain Admin vs Product Workflow UX

### The Two UX Patterns

Products and domains serve different user needs and should follow different UX patterns:

#### Product Workflow UX

Products are where Gary **does work**. The UX optimizes for speed, clarity, and flow.

| Characteristic | Pattern | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Navigation** | Primary sidebar entry | "Quotes" in main nav |
| **List view** | Filterable, sortable table/board with status indicators | Job Kanban board, Quote list with status badges |
| **Detail view** | Rich multi-section layout with actions | Quote detail: header → line items → pricing → actions |
| **State transitions** | Prominent action buttons with confirmation | "Accept Quote" → "Convert to Job" |
| **Empty state** | Guided onboarding, "Create your first ___" | "No quotes yet. Create your first quote →" |
| **Keyboard shortcuts** | Yes — power user acceleration | `N` for new, `E` for edit |
| **Real-time updates** | Yes (Phase 2) — board refreshes, status badges update | Job moves on Kanban board |

#### Domain Admin UX

Domains are where Gary **configures** the system. The UX optimizes for accuracy, safety, and discoverability.

| Characteristic | Pattern | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Navigation** | Settings sub-page or embedded in product | "Settings → Pricing", garment picker in quote form |
| **List view** | Simple table with edit actions, no status column | Pricing template list, color catalog |
| **Detail view** | Form-focused with preview/validation | Price matrix editor with margin preview |
| **Changes** | Save/Cancel with validation feedback | "Save Template" with undo support |
| **Empty state** | Pre-populated defaults with "Customize" option | Industry-default pricing template pre-loaded |
| **Keyboard shortcuts** | Minimal — accuracy over speed | Tab through fields |
| **Real-time updates** | No — configuration changes are deliberate | Save, then see effect in next quote |

### Side-by-Side Comparison

└─────────────────────────┘             └─────────────────────────┘

  • Status filters prominent                • No status column
  • Action buttons for state transitions     • Save/Cancel for configuration
  • Multi-row list with badges              • Single-record editor
  • Real-time status updates                • Deliberate save action
```

### When a Domain Needs Product-Like UX

Sometimes a domain entity grows complex enough to warrant richer UX. Signals:

1. Gary says "I spend 20 minutes setting this up every time" → needs a wizard/guided flow
2. The configuration has **dependencies** (changing one value affects others) → needs preview/validation
3. Multiple users will configure it independently → needs versioning/history

In these cases, the domain stays a domain (it's still configuration), but the **admin surface** borrows product UX patterns (multi-step wizard, preview, undo).

**Example**: The Price Matrix editor is domain configuration, but it has product-like UX (power mode, margin preview, bulk editing) because pricing configuration is complex and error-prone.
