You are starting a **cool-down** session between build cycles for Screen Print Pro.

## Your Mission

Step back from building and assess the project holistically. Update the ROADMAP, review open issues, and plan the next cycle.

## Startup Sequence

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project context
2. Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` for current priorities
3. Read `PROGRESS.md` for what's been built
4. Read recent KB docs across all verticals
5. Check open GitHub Issues: `gh issue list --repo cmbays/print-4ink --state open`

## Cool-Down Steps

1. **Progress snapshot**: What was accomplished since last cool-down?
2. **Issue triage**: Review open GitHub Issues, re-prioritize if needed
3. **Gary sync**: List all unresolved Gary questions across KB docs
4. **ROADMAP update**: Adjust priorities based on recent learnings
5. **Next cycle planning**: Which vertical(s) to focus on next?

## Output

- Updated `docs/ROADMAP.md` with current state
- Issue triage summary (closed stale issues, re-prioritized)
- Recommendation for next build cycle focus

## Session Protocol

- Rename this session: `claude session rename cooldown`
- This is an interactive session — discuss priorities with the user
- Commit ROADMAP updates when agreed upon
