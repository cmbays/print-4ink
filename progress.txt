| 2026-02-07 | Data layer | Created Zod schemas, constants, mock data |
| 2026-02-07 | Documentation | Created canonical doc framework: PRD, APP_FLOW, TECH_STACK, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN |
| 2026-02-07 | Methodology | Evaluated Ryan Singer's shaping-skills repo. Decided against full adoption (project past 0-to-1 phase, existing docs cover most needs). Extracted 3 patterns: spikes for unknowns, affordance decomposition, pre-build interview. Added Pre-Build Ritual to CLAUDE.md and pre-build tasks to Steps 4 and 6 in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN. Created `docs/spikes/` directory. |
| 2026-02-07 | For Human Docs | Created `for_human/` framework: index.html (navigable), README.md (index table + bundling rules), first session doc (shaping-skills evaluation). Added standing rule to CLAUDE.md to always create/update for_human docs after completing work. Configured CodeRabbit with local learning scope. |

Added Project Skills section to CLAUDE.md. Skills encode design system, quality checklist, and domain knowledge into repeatable workflows for Steps 1-10. |
| 2026-02-07 | CI + Testing | Set up Vitest with schema validation tests (66 tests across 6 files). Created GitHub Actions CI workflow (typecheck, lint, test, build). Fixed mock data UUIDs — Zod v4 validates RFC-4122 variant byte strictly. Added Vitest to TECH_STACK.md. |
| 2026-02-08 | Agent Architecture | Created 5 agents (.claude/agents/) and 4 new skills (.claude/skills/). Agents: frontend-builder, requirements-interrogator, design-auditor, feature-strategist, doc-sync. Skills: pre-build-interrogator, design-audit, feature-strategy, doc-sync. Created AGENTS.md registry, agent-outputs/ directory, and updated CLAUDE.md with agent infrastructure section. Addressed CodeRabbit review: fixed .gitignore nested file tracking, added markdown language tags, corrected branch metadata, added research methodology step to feature-strategy. Merged PR #6 to main. |
| 2026-02-08 | Strategic Pivot: Vertical-by-Vertical | Implemented comprehensive pivot from linear 10-step plan to vertical-by-vertical approach. Created: (1) `.claude/plans/vertical-by-vertical-strategy.md` (full strategic rationale, 4-phase methodology per vertical, pilot Quoting plan, roadmap for 4 subsequent verticals, success criteria, 23-33 day timeline); (2) `docs/strategy/quoting-discovery-interview-questions.md` (30-45 min interview guide, 25+ structured questions covering workflow/pain points/interconnections/wishlist); (3) `docs/competitive-analysis/print-life-quoting-analysis.md` (template for Print Life feature/UI/workflow analysis, ready for user's trial data); (4) `docs/competitive-analysis/print-life-journey-quoting.md` (template for journey map with friction points, click/time analysis, interconnections); (5) `docs/strategy/quoting-scope-definition.md` (comprehensive scope: CORE/PERIPHERAL/INTERCONNECTIONS, acceptance criteria per feature, quality checklist); (6) `docs/strategy/STRATEGY_README.md` (master index, how to use each doc by phase, cross-references); (7) `for_human/2026-02-08-strategic-pivot.html` (beautiful summary for user review). Committed 2 PRs: dfe61cd (#7) + abb6063. Updated progress.txt with document map and blocking dependencies. Ready for user's Quoting discovery phase (interview + Print Life trial). |
| 2026-02-08 | For Human Template Standardization | Created `for_human/_template.html` reference template. Standardized all 6 existing HTML files with consistent header: back nav, tag pills (6 types: Feature/Build/Plan/Decision/Research/Learning), meta grid (Date/Branch/Phase/Vertical), session resume, related session navigation. Updated `index.html` with multi-tag support, `README.md` with template docs, `CLAUDE.md` For Human Docs section with tag definitions and template rules. |
| 2026-02-08 | Quoting Discovery: COMPLETE | Conducted full discovery phase for Quoting vertical. (1) **Playwright exploration**: Set up headless browser in /tmp/pw-explorer/, navigated through 4Ink's customer portal at project-builder.app. Captured Steps 1-3 (product catalog, qty/size entry, art upload). Documented: 6-step flow, 103 color swatches, blocking recalculation, Angular SPA with S&S Activewear data. Steps 4-6 unreachable without art upload. (2) **Web research**: Print Life founded by Cam Earven, ~200 shops, Angular SPA, solo dev, QuickBooks integration. 2024 updates: impression cost display. Q1 2025: payment fixes, matrix pricing types. (3) **User interview**: 5-20 quotes/week, 50/50 simple/complex, 10 min per quote. Critical pain: recalculation blocks input, mandatory unused steps, forced color swatches, art style change resets all selections. Wants: hybrid approval (customer submits → shop reviews price → approves), quote reuse/duplication, keyboard navigation, simpler workflow. Currently builds quotes internally, communicates price by phone. No formal quote tracking. Tools: Print Life + QuickBooks + Excel + Email + Shopify + Square. (4) **Documents completed**: print-life-quoting-analysis.md (full feature list, 10 friction points, UI patterns, competitive landscape), print-life-journey-quoting.md (step-by-step journey, time distribution, success metrics), screen-print-pro-journey-quoting.md (redesigned single-page flow, targets 60-70% time reduction, S&S color swatch grid, instant pricing, hybrid approval). Updated quoting-scope-definition.md with all findings (S&S color swatch component, price override, quote notes, Revised status, functional Duplicate/Edit). (5) **4Ink owner request**: Color swatches should use S&S Activewear-style dense palette with color names in white font overlaid on swatches. |
| 2026-02-08 | Breadboarding Skill | Reassessed shaping-skills decision post-pivot. Promoted breadboarding from Phase 2 deferral to full Phase 1 skill. Created: (1) `.claude/skills/breadboarding/SKILL.md` (9-step workflow: identify places, map UI/code affordances, map data stores, verify wiring, identify component boundaries, define build order); (2) `.claude/skills/breadboarding/templates/breadboard-template.md` (output template with YAML frontmatter); (3) `.claude/skills/breadboarding/reference/concepts.md` (key concepts: affordances, places, wiring, component boundaries). Integrated into workflow: updated vertical-by-vertical-strategy.md with Phase 2.5 (Breadboarding), updated CLAUDE.md (architecture, pre-build ritual, skills table, orchestration patterns), updated frontend-builder agent (added breadboarding to skills, breadboard-first startup sequence), updated AGENTS.md (Vertical Build Chain pattern, 5 orchestration patterns). Created `docs/breadboards/` directory. Ran doc-sync agent to fix drift in MEMORY.md and STRATEGY_README.md. Skill count: 6 → 8 (added vertical-discovery + breadboarding). |
| 2026-02-08 | Quoting Vertical: BUILD COMPLETE | Built full Quoting vertical using git worktree (`feature/quoting-build`) and 6 parallel agents via TeamCreate. **Phase A** (4 agents parallel): (1) schema-agent updated quote/garment schemas, created color schema, expanded mock data (5 customers, 42 colors, 5 garment catalog, 6 quotes), added 116 tests; (2) swatch-agent built ColorSwatchPicker (308 lines, S&S-style dense grid, search, favorites, keyboard nav); (3) combobox-agent built CustomerCombobox + AddCustomerModal; (4) list-agent built QuotesDataTable + StatusBadge + quotes page. **Phase B** (2 agents after A): (5) form-agent built QuoteForm + LineItemRow + PricingSummary + new quote page; (6) detail-agent built quote detail page + QuoteActions + EmailPreviewModal. Fixed all lint errors (7→0). All checks pass: tsc 0 errors, lint 0 errors/warnings, 116/116 tests, production build success. PR #13 created. 31 files changed, 3874 insertions. |
| 2026-02-08 | Quoting Patch v2 | Addressed 20 feedback items from 4Ink first-round review. **Phase A**: New artwork schema, customer tags (new/repeat/contract), service types (screen-print/dtf/embroidery), per-location print details (replaces flat locations), discount model (replaces priceOverride), shipping+tax fields, 8 mock artworks, 8 SVG placeholders. Updated all 6 mock quotes. 171 tests passing. **Phase B-F**: PricingSummary redesign (full breakdown with discounts/shipping/tax/savings), DiscountRow, LineItemRow rewrite (service type selector, per-location details with artwork assignment), ArtworkLibrary (customer-tag-aware), ArtworkUploadModal, ArtworkAssignmentPicker, ArtworkPreview, CollapsibleSection, QuoteDetailView (reusable detail/review), QuoteReviewSheet (slide-from-right), form restructure (5 collapsible sections), customer-aware defaults (contract=auto-discount+free-shipping, new=upload-only, repeat=recently-used-first), CustomerCombobox tags+phone, AddCustomerModal phone+tag, QuoteActions inline header bar. Fixed duplicate quote bug and search re-render loop. All checks pass: tsc 0 errors, lint 0 errors/2 warnings, 171/171 tests, production build success. |
