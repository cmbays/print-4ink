# Screen Print Pro — Progress

## Current State

**Phase**: 1 — Mockup with mock data
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-07
**Last Verified**: 2026-02-07
**Status**: Scaffold complete, documentation framework established, ready for feature build

## What's Built

### Infrastructure
- [x] Next.js 16.1.6 scaffold with App Router, TypeScript, Turbopack
- [x] Tailwind v4 with design tokens in `globals.css` (`@theme inline`)
- [x] shadcn/ui components: button, card, dialog, input, table, badge, dropdown-menu, tabs, separator, tooltip, label, select, textarea, sheet, breadcrumb, avatar, form
- [x] Fonts: Inter + JetBrains Mono via `next/font`
- [x] Dark mode default (`className="dark"` on `<html>`)
- [x] Vitest setup with schema tests (66 tests, 6 test files)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI: type check + lint + test + build on push/PR to main

### Layout Shell
- [x] `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — sidebar + topbar + main content area
- [x] `components/layout/sidebar.tsx` — navigation with 6 links (Dashboard, Jobs, Quotes, Customers, Screen Room, Garments)
- [x] `components/layout/topbar.tsx` — top bar component

### Dashboard (`/`)
- [x] Summary cards: Blocked, In Progress, Shipped, Total Jobs
- [x] "Needs Attention" section — jobs awaiting artwork approval
- [x] "In Progress" section — active jobs with status + priority badges
- [x] Uses mock data from `lib/mock-data.ts`

### Data Layer
- [x] Zod schemas: `job.ts`, `quote.ts`, `customer.ts`, `garment.ts`, `screen.ts`
- [x] Constants: production state labels/colors, priority labels/colors, burn status labels, quote status labels
- [x] Mock data: 3 customers, 6 jobs, 3 quotes, 5 screens

### Project Skills (`.claude/skills/`)
- [x] `screen-builder` — Workflow + templates + checklists + reference for building Steps 1-10
  - Templates: data-table-screen, detail-screen, form-screen
  - Checklists: quality (10 items), cross-link (4 items)
  - Reference: design tokens quick ref, component inventory
- [x] `quality-gate` — 10-category audit with pass/fail scoring
  - Categories: visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, color, interactive states, icons, motion, empty/error states, accessibility, jobs filter
  - Rubric: scoring guide with verdict rules + report template

### Documentation
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` — AI operating rules, design system, coding standards
- [x] `docs/PROJECT_BIBLE.md` — Domain context and workflow overview
- [x] `docs/reference/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md` — Full design tokens + component patterns
- [x] `docs/reference/UX_USER_RESEARCH.md` — User pain points, "Love Factor"
- [x] `docs/reference/UX_HEURISTICS.md` — 10-point quality checklist
- [x] `docs/reference/UX_TASK_FLOWS.md` — Ideal user journey mappings
- [x] `docs/reference/APP_FLOW_STANDARD.md` — Template for APP_FLOW docs
- [x] `docs/TECH_STACK.md` — Tool choices with decision context
- [x] `docs/PRD.md` — Phase 1 features, scope, acceptance criteria
- [x] `docs/APP_FLOW.md` — Routes, screens, navigation paths
- [x] `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Sequenced build steps

## What's Next

See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the full build sequence. Next up:
- Step 1: Shared layout polish (sidebar active states, topbar search, breadcrumbs)
- Step 2: Jobs List page (`/jobs`)
- Step 3: Job Detail page (`/jobs/[id]`)

## Session Log

| Date | Session | Work Done |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 2026-02-07 | Initial setup | Scaffolded project, installed deps, configured Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui |
| 2026-02-07 | Dashboard MVP | Built dashboard with summary cards, blocked/in-progress sections |
| 2026-02-07 | Data layer | Created Zod schemas, constants, mock data |
| 2026-02-07 | Documentation | Created canonical doc framework: PRD, APP_FLOW, TECH_STACK, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN |
| 2026-02-07 | Methodology | Evaluated Ryan Singer's shaping-skills repo. Decided against full adoption (project past 0-to-1 phase, existing docs cover most needs). Extracted 3 patterns: spikes for unknowns, affordance decomposition, pre-build interview. Added Pre-Build Ritual to CLAUDE.md and pre-build tasks to Steps 4 and 6 in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN. Created `docs/spikes/` directory. |
| 2026-02-07 | For Human Docs | Created `for_human/` framework: index.html (navigable), README.md (index table + bundling rules), first session doc (shaping-skills evaluation). Added standing rule to CLAUDE.md to always create/update for_human docs after completing work. Configured CodeRabbit with local learning scope. |
| 2026-02-07 | Skills | Created 2 project skills in `.claude/skills/`: `screen-builder` (workflow + 3 templates + 2 checklists + 2 reference docs) and `quality-gate` (10-category audit + scoring rubric). Added Project Skills section to CLAUDE.md. Skills encode design system, quality checklist, and domain knowledge into repeatable workflows for Steps 1-10. |
| 2026-02-07 | CI + Testing | Set up Vitest with schema validation tests (66 tests across 6 files). Created GitHub Actions CI workflow (typecheck, lint, test, build). Fixed mock data UUIDs — Zod v4 validates RFC-4122 variant byte strictly. Added Vitest to TECH_STACK.md. |
