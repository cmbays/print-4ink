# [COMPETITOR] — [VERTICAL] Journey Map

**Purpose**: Document [COMPETITOR]'s actual [VERTICAL] workflow with friction points to inform Screen Print Pro design
**Input**: Playwright exploration + user interview
**Status**: [Draft / Complete]

## Terminology: Internal vs External [VERTICAL]

| Term | Definition | Phase |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Internal [VERTICAL]** | Shop operator performs [TASK] using internal tools. | **Phase 1** (building now) |
| **External [VERTICAL]** | Customer self-service for [TASK]. | **Phase 2** |

## Friction Point Inventory

| # | Friction Point | Step(s) | Severity | Why It Matters | Our Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | Critical | | |
| 2 | | | High | | |
| 3 | | | Medium | | |

**Severity Guide**:
- **Critical**: Blocks workflow or causes data loss
- **High**: Adds significant time or causes rework
- **Medium**: Annoying but workable
- **Low**: Minor inconvenience
