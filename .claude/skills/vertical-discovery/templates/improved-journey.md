# Screen Print Pro — Improved [VERTICAL] Journey

**Purpose**: Design the 10x better [VERTICAL] workflow based on competitor analysis and user interview
**Input**: Playwright exploration, user interview, competitive analysis, scope definition
**Status**: [Draft / Complete] — [ready for build phase / awaiting review]

## Terminology: Internal vs External [VERTICAL]

| Term                    | Definition                                          | Phase                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Internal [VERTICAL]** | Shop operator performs [TASK] using internal tools. | **Phase 1** (building now)                         |
| **External [VERTICAL]** | Customer self-service for [TASK].                   | **Phase 2**                                        |
| **Hybrid Approval**     | Customer self-service + shop approval gate.         | **Phase 2** (shop-side status tracking in Phase 1) |

**Phase 1 builds**: [INTERNAL DESCRIPTION]. All customer-facing flows show UI mockups but don't actually [SEND/PROCESS].
**Phase 2 builds**: [EXTERNAL DESCRIPTION].

## Journey Overview

### Internal [TASK] (Shop builds for customer)

**Target**:

- Simple [TASK]: **[X] minutes**, **[X] clicks** (vs [COMPETITOR] [X] min, [X] clicks)
- Complex [TASK]: **[X] minutes**, **[X] clicks** (vs [COMPETITOR] [X] min, [X] clicks)

### External [TASK] (Customer self-service) — PHASE 2

**Target** (aspirational, not building in Phase 1):

## Key Differences from [COMPETITOR]

| Aspect    | [COMPETITOR] | Screen Print Pro |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| **Flow**  |              |                  |
| **Steps** |              |                  |
| **Speed** |              |                  |
| **State** |              |                  |
