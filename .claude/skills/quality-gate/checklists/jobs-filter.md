# 10. Jobs Filter (Density)

The Jobs Filter is the discipline of removing everything that doesn't earn its place.

## Criteria

- [ ] Every element on the screen was reviewed with the 3 questions below
- [ ] No redundant information (same data shown twice)
- [ ] No decorative elements that don't serve function
- [ ] Information density is appropriate — not too sparse, not too cluttered
- [ ] The screen feels "inevitable" — like no other design was possible

## The 3 Questions

For **every element** on the screen, ask:

### 1. "Can this be removed without losing meaning?"

If yes → remove it. Less is more. Every element adds cognitive load.

### 2. "Would a user need to be told this exists?"

If yes → redesign it until it's obvious. The best UI is invisible.

### 3. "Does this feel inevitable, like no other design was possible?"

If no → it's not done. Keep iterating.

## How to Check

1. List every visual element on the screen (headers, labels, badges, icons, buttons, dividers)
2. For each, ask the 3 questions
3. Flag any element that fails a question
4. Recommend removal or redesign

## Common Failures

- Redundant labels (e.g., "Status: Approval" when the badge already says "Approval")
- Decorative separators between items that already have card borders
- "Created by" or metadata that the user doesn't care about
- Tooltips that repeat information already visible on screen
