# {Topic} — Frame

**Pipeline:** {pipeline-id or "standalone"}
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Draft

## Source

> [Paste verbatim source material here — user requests, interview quotes, emails,
>
> > slack messages, stakeholder feedback. Preserve exact wording. Multiple sources
> > can be added as they arrive.]

## Problem

[Distill from source material. What's broken? What pain exists? What opportunity
is being missed? Be specific — not "the system is slow" but "users wait 30s for
the quote PDF to generate, causing them to switch to manual calculations."]

---

## Outcome

[What success looks like. High-level, not solution-specific. Describe the end state,
not the mechanism. Not "add a cache layer" but "quote PDFs generate in under 2s."]
