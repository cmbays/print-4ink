# Pitch: [Title]

**Appetite**: [small (1-2 sessions) | medium (3-5 sessions) | large (5+ sessions)]
**Category**: [new-vertical | revisit | infrastructure | tooling]
**Phase**: [1 | 2 | 3]

## Problem

What user pain or project need does this address? Be specific — reference feedback, issues, or observations.

## Solution Sketch

High-level approach. Not a detailed spec — just enough to understand the shape of the work. Include:
- Key components or artifacts that would be produced
- Rough approach (not implementation details)
- What "done" looks like

## Rabbit Holes

What to explicitly avoid or defer. Things that could expand scope if not bounded:
- [thing to avoid and why]
- [thing to defer to a later cycle]

## Dependencies

What must be true before this can start?
