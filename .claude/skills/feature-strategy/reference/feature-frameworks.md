# Feature Thinking Frameworks

Use these frameworks to categorize and evaluate feature opportunities. Every proposed feature must fit into one of these categories. If it doesn't, it probably doesn't belong.

## Journey Completers

Close loops where users start something but can't finish it — or finish it unsatisfied.

**Questions to find them:**

- Where does the user's workflow hit a dead end?
- What information does the user need to look up outside the app?
- Where does the user have to switch to another tool to finish a task?
- What steps feel incomplete or half-baked?

**Example**: User creates a quote but can't convert it to a job without re-entering data. A "Convert to Job" button is a journey completer.

## Value Compounders

Make existing features more valuable — not standalone additions. These features are cheap because they build on what already exists.

**Questions to find them:**

- What data does the app already collect that isn't being used?
- What two features, if connected, would be more valuable together?
- What insights could be derived from existing data?
- What automation could replace manual steps between features?

**Example**: Job status history already tracks state changes. Adding a timeline view to each job shows how long each stage took — zero new data, high insight.

## Retention Hooks

Give users a reason to come back without being reminded. The app should be where the user WANTS to start their day.

**Questions to find them:**

- What does the user need to check every morning?
- What information changes overnight that matters?
- What notifications would the user actually appreciate?
- What dashboard widget would make the user open the app first?

**Example**: "Morning briefing" dashboard showing overnight customer messages, jobs nearing deadlines, and screens ready for burning.

## Delight Moments

Small, unexpected touches that make users feel something. These cost almost nothing but create outsized emotional impact.

**Questions to find them:**

- Where can the app surprise the user with helpfulness?
- What tedious step can be automated without being asked?
- Where can the app show intelligence about the user's patterns?
- What micro-interaction would make the user smile?

**Example**: Auto-suggesting the last-used garment brand/color when creating a new quote for a returning customer.

## Friction Killers

Remove steps, reduce decisions, eliminate confusion. Every removed step is a saved minute multiplied by every user, every day, forever.

**Questions to find them:**

- Where does the user click more than 3 times to reach a destination?
- What forms ask for information the app already knows?
- Where does the user have to make a decision that has an obvious default?
- What confirmations are unnecessary for non-destructive actions?

**Example**: Quick-search with keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K) that searches across jobs, customers, quotes — instead of navigating to each section.

## Monetization Enablers

Features so valuable users WANT to pay — not paywalls or artificial limits. These make the product genuinely more valuable for power users.

**Questions to find them:**

- What would a user pay $10/month more for?
- What capability would justify upgrading from free to paid?
- What feature would the user's BOSS want to pay for?
- What saves the user more money than the subscription costs?

**Example**: Production analytics showing average turnaround time, bottleneck stages, and cost-per-job — helps the owner price accurately and identify inefficiencies.

## Platform Extenders

Leverage platform capabilities that most web apps ignore. These create sticky, native-feeling experiences.

**Questions to find them:**

- What desktop shortcuts would power users want? (Cmd+K, Cmd+N)
- What drag-and-drop interactions feel natural for this domain?
- What data could be useful offline or in a widget?
- What integrations would eliminate tool-switching?

**Example**: Keyboard shortcuts for power users: Cmd+K (search), Cmd+N (new job), arrow keys to navigate tables, Enter to open detail.

## Evaluation Criteria

For every proposed feature, answer:

1. **Does it serve the user journey?** If not, cut it.
2. **Does it compound the value of what already exists?** If not, it's an isolated addition — lower priority.
3. **Can it ship without breaking what works?** If not, it needs careful sequencing.
4. **What would make a user show this to a friend?** If this feature doesn't move that needle, deprioritize it.
5. **Is this the simplest version that delivers the value?** If not, simplify until it is.
