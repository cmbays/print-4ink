# Feature Plan — [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Context**: [What prompted this analysis — competitor review, user feedback, milestone checkpoint]
**Scope**: [What area of the app or user journey this plan covers]

## Research Methodology

- **Sources reviewed**: [List docs, screenshots, user feedback consulted]
- **User research**: [Pain points identified, usage patterns observed]
- **Competitive analysis**: [Competitors examined, features compared]
- **Constraints validated**: [Tech stack limits, schema constraints, timeline]

## Executive Summary

[3-5 sentences. The app's biggest opportunity right now. What's working, what's missing, and what would create the most value.]

## Current State

### Working Well

- [Feature/screen that's solid and ready]

### Almost There

- [Feature that's 80% done, needs the last 20%]

### Missing

- [Capability the user journey demands that doesn't exist yet]

### At Risk

- [Feature that could break or regress without attention]

## Phase 1 — Ship This Week

High impact, low effort. 3-5 features max. The "how is this not already there?" features.

### Feature 1: [Name]

- **What**: [What it does]
- **Why now**: [Why this matters immediately]
- **Builds on**: [What existing feature/data it leverages]
- **Doesn't touch**: [What it explicitly avoids changing]
- **Type**: [Journey Completer / Value Compounder / Friction Killer / etc.]
- **Implementation context**: [Enough for build agent to plan, NOT code]

### Feature 2: [Name]

[Same structure]

## Phase 2 — Ship This Sprint

More effort, significant value. 4-6 features max. The features that make the app feel professional.

### Feature 1: [Name]

[Same structure as Phase 1 features]

## Phase 3 — Ship This Quarter

Strategic investment. 3-5 features max. The features that create competitive moats.

### Feature 1: [Name]

[Same structure as Phase 1 features]

## Parking Lot

Ideas that are too early or too expensive right now but shouldn't be forgotten.

- **[Idea]**: [Why it's parked] — Revisit: [when/condition]

## Rejected Ideas

3-5 ideas you considered and cut, with reasoning. Shows your thinking discipline.

- **[Idea]**: [Why it was rejected — what gate did it fail?]

## Dependency Map

What must be built before what. Use this to sequence implementation.

```
Phase 1 Feature A → Phase 2 Feature C (needs A's data model)
Phase 1 Feature B → Phase 2 Feature D (needs B's UI component)
Phase 2 Feature C → Phase 3 Feature F (needs C's API)
```

## Notes for Build Agent

- [Any technical constraints to be aware of]
- [Any design system tokens that might need adding]
- [Any schema changes required]
